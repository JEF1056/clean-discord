Pleinair	@Ryuse i feel ya
Pleinair	i think the hardest part about drawing is FINISHING the piece
Ryuse	For me its lineart
Ryuse	None
Denii	YE
Denii	ITY IS
Pleinair	getting that motivation to go thru step by step is tiring
Ryuse	Which is what Im doing now
Denii	LINEART IS HARD
Ryuse	But once you start coloring
Denii	xD if you look at my art
Ryuse	shit happens
Pleinair	killer drag
Denii	you can see i never did the lineart

boringwallofsalmon	Why does this exist
QIQI	I improve in my drawing because of the quarantine

rian	None
BakaBot	if its active enough sure
rian	yess
Cloudy	I hope it stays. I like to be able to chat about art
rian	samee
None	😦 dont u guys hate it when you thought u colored something and its just transparent
Pleinair	, happens way too often
Pleinair	make a new layer
None	TT I know but like... omg Im just so tired and it just happens
Pleinair	put it underneath the entire work and use any color as a base layer so your stuff isnt transparent
Pleinair	then smack in a levels layer if you need to
Pleinair	that your your work you did previously will be seen as 100 solid
None	I get what youre saying but XD I need some outside area to be transparent
Pleinair	oh
None	Its very hard to explain...
Pleinair	time to hang yourself
Pleinair	thats tiring to do
Pleinair	well depends on how big that outside area is
Pleinair	if your using the whole canvas
None	Uhhh... lets say about... 50
Pleinair	you should be fine, otherwise you gotta fill out those other layers
Pleinair	by using the lasso tool
None	TT... yeah limme get some rope
Pleinair	polygon lasso tool will prolly help
None	None
None	Since I cannot post pics
None	Its basically this situation that annoys me
Pleinair	oh thats not so bad
Pleinair	i thought you meant like
None	Uhhh I mean idk... Ive been drawing for about 3 hrs now so... it just makes me so sad

Delcina	ill post my Serpent Pillar artwork tomorrow.
Ryuse	My works take a long time
Ryuse	kek
Cloudy	Yeah I understand.
Delcina	heyo Cloud.
Delcina	None
Ryuse	cuz Im lazy
Cloudy	Hii
Cloudy	None
KOANGEL	Ryuseee duuudee, your work is really nice bc of the fact you actually finish
KOANGEL	Yoo
Ryuse	Hmm
Ryuse	Those are my old works tho
KOANGEL	I have a question for the both of you
KOANGEL	How did you get commissions easily? Or at all, Im bad at it,
KOANGEL	I want money heck
Ryuse	I dont
Cloudy	Uhh no. its difficult especially with my small following
Delcina	heyo Ryuse
Cloudy	I do get some tho
Delcina	None
Ryuse	Hai Rin
KOANGEL	Is it from ppl u know or followers more
Ryuse	I used to do em but now I dont XD
Ryuse	Cuz I want freedom
KOANGEL	Get that ryuse yes
Cloudy	More from people I know?
KOANGEL	And ah okay
KOANGEL	No its whatever, I just gotta grow more, this shii hard
Cloudy	It takes time
Ryuse	Hmm
Ryuse	I would suggest
Ryuse	just getting better at art first
Ryuse	I know this sounds generic but it really is true
Ryuse	You gotta set the expectation for others
Ryuse	about what they will get when they commission you
Ryuse	Then afterwards its the pricing
Ryuse	Then after you set the price you market
Ryuse	Marketing is often overlooked
Ryuse	but is essential
Ryuse	But marketing and setting the price wont matter much if our art is subpar
Ryuse	so we gotta keep our art quality up
Ryuse	thats just from my experience
Pleinair	its also how you practice
Pleinair	try drawing the same thing in a different way or method, line art isnt for everyone
Pleinair	and dont always stuck on trying to have a set style
Pleinair	but if you do, dont be afraid to explore and develop on it, rather than be fixated and using it as an excuse to not get better
Pleinair	also try doing drawing sessions with friends
Pleinair	i mentioned this before but drawpile is a great way to do that, if you dont do digital, just being in call together and setting aside even 1 hr of your time with friends is enough for you to learn
KOANGEL	@Ryuse @Pleinair wow thats helpful, all is true too thank tysmm
QIQI	for me its kinda hard for a new artist to start to get tons of commission since theres alot of good competitors. Marketing is my strategy. i try to get involve in many community share my artwork and improve at the same time. You wont get good result for a few couple of months. But slowly you will get followers who like your art.
KOANGEL	Oh boy, I really gotta bring up my game then, and collaborate with others yeah.
QIQI	If youre marketing arent good, no matter how beautiful your art is, no onewill notice. The easiest way to start to get followers or anyone to even look at your drawing is to draw some mainstream stuff. very cliche but it work. Once you get followers you can draw anything and people will like it
KOANGEL	Im patient but it sucks how it takes a while if so
KOANGEL	Hmmm mainstream, okay
QIQI	patient is the key success take time! But you can do it!!! Yeh draw mainstream is the easiest way to gain popularity
QIQI	from my experience
KOANGEL	Somth ppl will like is easy and hard,
KOANGEL	Okay, thank you mogu!
Ryuse	Mogu share your social media link
KOANGEL	O right, I didnt see you work mogu, if u want ofc
KOANGEL	Your
QIQI	me I just started using my social this year so theres nothing much
QIQI	my work
KELLY	bruh we talking about insta or something
QIQI	i wish i can share
QIQI	cant share image
QIQI	dont know how the server roles work tbh
Ryuse	You can share links here iirc
Ryuse	whats your exp?
QIQI	I just got here two days ago
QIQI	I send an artwork for the sakura contest
QIQI	None
KOANGEL	Oh idk Im sure should have around I think 500 xp to be able I post images in artwork chat
QIQI	you can find my insta in sakura onsen insta, they tag me
Ryuse	Found it

Cloudy	Looks great! Very goodsss
QIQI	thank you thank you
KOANGEL	Holy shit
KOANGEL	Its amazing
Ryuse	None
QIQI	thank you, Im very surprised aswell that the background turn out good.
KOANGEL	hwrahHRAWAHHRAAHH
KOANGEL	I gotta get better at backgroundsss
QIQI	The easiest way to do that is reference
KOANGEL	Im not bad, but digital is harder, weird
QIQI	people said perspective, but freak perspective.!XD
KOANGEL	Always reference my friend
QIQI	reference and alittle bit of imagination is all you need
KOANGEL	Perspective is actually interesting to me, I work on it often
KOANGEL	Look in artwork
KOANGEL	One sec
KOANGEL	Weakness hands that fit the pose
Ryuse	Solution Just draw em with no hands
Ryuse	ez
QIQI	true
QIQI	you can look at pinterest for pose reference
QIQI	like if you gonna go with sexy sitting pose
Ryuse	None
QIQI	just type sexy model sitting pose XD
Ryuse	Heres how u draw hand
QIQI	Lmaooo
KOANGEL	I expected something far difference.
KOANGEL	But Im not even disappointed
KOANGEL	None
Cloudy	None
Cloudy	Well imma head to bed goodnight
Ryuse	Art memes
Ryuse	Well if you keep marketing you can get a lot of followers
KOANGEL	Gnnn

QIQI	@Ryuse truee take time but sooo truee
Ryuse	Also
Ryuse	Marketing campains
Ryuse	seo
Ryuse	market segmenting
Ryuse	Yeah more theory
Ryuse	its boring but it helps
QIQI	it actually help tbh. since i learn the same thing in my school
KOANGEL	Its cool to know here bc, its like behind the scenes, and not a yt vid where it feels harder to do
Ryuse	I once met an artist for Azur Lane
Ryuse	called her senpai and she loves drawing big boobs
Ryuse	Shes always staying up late to draw XD
Ryuse	But damn she draws fast and her drawings are really good
QIQI	pro man, I wannabe like that one day, fast but masterpiece
QIQI	None
Pleinair	hmm
Pleinair	ya watching others draw or show their technique is a good way to learning as well
Pleinair	since you get a grasp of a workflow you could practice
Taichi	how to be pro in anatomy real quick!
Taichi	None

foxburton99	Does anyone know how to get the artist role and the role for posting images in artwork ?Im new here
cat🐱	so you need 500xp to post image
BakaBot	or the artist role
cat🐱	and the artist role is basically saying that you are an artist
cat🐱	and to get one by posting at the artwork or maybe ask from a mod
cat🐱	None
cat🐱	thats all i know
BakaBot	you can ask mods but you have to send a pic as evidence
foxburton99	Is there a channel for asking mods stuff like this or do I need to DM?
BakaBot	dms are fine
BakaBot	at least for me
foxburton99	Thank you
foxburton99	Oh I didnt realize you were a mod. Should I send you just one piece of art?
BakaBot	sure
foxburton99	Kk just a moment
skhema	@munzhine Uhm, sorry about your confidence ! But honestly it so subjective... Every style is beautiful. And all pieces of art are a lot work.thank you for positive reaction
skhema	Im glad to discover the contest. It was a coincidence, really. Glad to leave the comfort zone. Kawaii character are not my main subject.
Pleinair	well some styles will always get more attention than others tbf
skhema	Yes this is absolutely right! I usually do non mainstream cyber stuff see my Avatar. And it is my choice to do no mainstream.Mimic styles can be fun. Dont you think?
Ryuse	I just do cute stuff
Ryuse	it seems to be well received
Pleinair	i do whatever i think is interesting at the time
skhema	There is different approaches. I think it is great to be free to choose the style!
skhema	hm, should I upload something I normally draw to the artwork channel?
Pleinair	sure i dont mind
skhema	show me one of yours @Pleinair at artwork channel
Pleinair	hmm sure
Pleinair	@skhema there
skhema	the third is best one. Anatomy is right.It is a bit horror.
bread	i cant seem to post anything in the artwork channel
Pleinair	hm? just ideas i been exploring
bread	do you know how i fix this?
skhema	About how to post at art channel is conversation above
skhema	so you need 500xp to post image@waaa is cat🐱 One need level or the role to post pics
cat🐱	yup
skhema	I think it is a good idea to include it to general info or rules, so not everyone is asking
cat🐱	you have an artist role so you can post even if you dont have 500xp
cat🐱	you can make a suggestion
skhema	right
crestfallen	You could send me your artwork
crestfallen	And I could give you the role
crestfallen	Lmao why did that sound weird
crestfallen	I swear its not supposed to sound weird
crestfallen	None
Pleinair	but ya been been playing around with designs to think about developing some styles
Pleinair	the 2nd one was more for like a game character design
Pleinair	simplistic to do and easy to animate in the long run
Pleinair	while giving enough information about a character while maintain a memorable form/silhouette
Pleinair	@bread ooo you did the background?
bread	got my art posted now
bread	i didnt do the background, however i do change the colours ect
bread	theyre mostly edits
skhema	I do backgrounds
bread	thats really good! woah
skhema	@Pleinair yes I understand. It is like character reference sheet.
skhema	@bread Thank you. I like the glitch effect on your second upload!
bread	thank u sm!
skhema	@bread how you translate the kanji in the illu?
bread	I just copied and pasted it from my discord name
bread	bread basically says breadbread. I first found out what bread was in kanji by just googling it
Pleinair	@Ryuse those mostly OCs you think of?
cat🐱	thats amazing skhema
cat🐱	None
bread	@skhema your work is so good! oh my
bread	youre so talented
skhema	@bread oh, yes!. pan katakana bread!
skhema	@waaa is cat🐱 Thank you waaa, always I log in you are here. Hope your pet is fine!
Pleinair	@skhema that your default style?
cat🐱	OwO
cat🐱	i dont have pet but thankiee
cat🐱	None
cat🐱	and your welcome
skhema	my default style is the last upload.
Pleinair	ya was referring to that!
Holo	Was painting
Holo	Finished
skhema	@waaa is cat🐱 I asked about the tamagotchi 😅
Holo	Got paint on my eyelid
Holo	How tf
Pleinair	whats your process for coloring?
cat🐱	oohh
cat🐱	None
cat🐱	yup its still alive
skhema	@Pleinair yes, it is default style... I am crazy about Blame! manga... so background! and cyber.
skhema	@Pleinair at who is question about coloring adressed?
Ryuse	@Pleinair yes
Pleinair	@skhema your coloring technique, ohh you like blame? that was a visually fun mango
Pleinair	guessing you also like sidonia?
skhema	@Pleinair Biomega IMHO is better than Sidonia. Aposimz is not bad too. Actually from Blame! I learned how to draw Bgs... something like this
skhema	@Pleinair colouring technique I do always outlines with ink. Scan it. And use GIMP to apply color. I do flat shading and than apply many various GIMP filters and textures.I can not paint digitally.It is interesting topic. That you asked, shows, that you are at some professional level.
skhema	@Pleinair I remember, you was yesterday here too. But I forgotten which software you are using to paint
Pleinair	i use photoshop and clip
skhema	is clip good? I was thinking to try the free 30days version.
skhema	People say it has good brush dynamics
Pleinair	its quite impressive i bought it on the sale and been using it for the whole month
Pleinair	for 25 dollars
Pleinair	its a great photoshop alternative
Pleinair	and yes the brushes are great
skhema	my problem is like... than I need a windows operating system... I own only a Linux 😅
Pleinair	AHHH
skhema	@Pleinair will you participate in draw sakura contest?
Pleinair	im thinking about it, im an awfully slow artist in the coloring process so if i finish it before hand sure
Pleinair	otherwise ive been sketching her for fun
cat🐱	OwO
cat🐱	good luck both of youu
cat🐱	None
skhema	ah, ok. BUT you can pick her colour from the chara sheet! @Pleinair
skhema	Colour should be not the problem!
Pleinair	oh i know that part, its just
Pleinair	the lighting i wanna render
skhema	@waaa is cat🐱 TYVM
Pleinair	idk what shade its gonna be yet if that makes sense
Pleinair	prolly dusk
Pleinair	so the colors in my head will change
skhema	I do maybe reduced colour with water colours...Dark colors are hard with traditionals.Or maybe BG traditional and Sakura digitally, hm...Ok, I am looking forward to see your Sakura @Pleinair !🙂
Pleinair	, same for yours!
lewd	Okay, I thought we could share our drawings, but no
lewd	None
Ryuse	You need the artist role
BakaBot	@lewd to post your art you either need the artist role or 500exp on this server, you can get the role by sending a piece of your art to a mod as evidence
Dexio	None
skhema	@BakaBot I cant post to suggestions channel, but why not to make information or something for the art channel. How much people are asking the same thing already.
KOANGEL	Also skhema, Im practicing perspective, I really aspire to be like exactly what you did, with backgrounds too
KOANGEL	Do you have more work I can see? I really like it
Cloudy	Something I need to work on too
cat🐱	if you want to suggest you can type suggest and the things you want to suggest in botcommands @skhema
BakaBot	an information is planned
BakaBot	and suggestions is only available via command in botcommands
skhema	@KOANGEL Im on Instagram. User name isskhema But Im taking small break from IG, will be back end of the next week on Insta.
skhema	Wait people, I show you the good book about perspective drawing
skhema	Search for how to draw scott robertsonnMaybe it is a bit complex to understand for not native ENG speaker, but it is very good IMHO. I like the way he explains things.
Ryuse	I know some great tutorials for anime :3
KOANGEL	the hands
Ryuse	Well yeah
Ryuse	I know a lot of resources
Ryuse	Ive been drawing for a while as a hobby kek
KOANGEL	Also thanks skhema ill check the book and you out :3
KOANGEL	My friends said my hobby is worth money so idk
Ryuse	Whats your hobby?
KOANGEL	I was fixated on it, I think Im a alchoholic
KOANGEL	Drawing drawing drawing
Ryuse	Ah
Ryuse	Well I did make money from drawing
KOANGEL	I kinda stopped drawing realism, I was so good at it
KOANGEL	Nice
Ryuse	Realism eh
Ryuse	I think I tried doing it once before
Ryuse	and mixed it with anime
Cloudy	I cant get away from anime
Ryuse	Its painful to do
Pleinair	hmm, gotta keep practicing
Cloudy	Love it too much
KOANGEL	Same, its addicting, the style
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	This is how it turned out
Cloudy	I did realism before too
Cloudy	Thats pretty good
KOANGEL	It is yeah, I saw on IG
Ryuse	This will be my first and the last
Cloudy	Aww
KOANGEL	Dont like it? Or is it just hard
Cloudy	I feel like you could go far with it honestly
Ryuse	I could
Ryuse	But I like anime
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	Look at this
Cloudy	I understand
Cloudy	I like that
KOANGEL	I SAW THAT AND I loved it sm
Ryuse	Something I did last year
Cloudy	The background!!!
Ryuse	That one is my most popular one
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	Then this is the most viewed
Cloudy	Yesss I liked this one too
KOANGEL	Ur so good at backgrounds
Cloudy	Omg I my art. so bad
Ryuse	Well
Ryuse	I think a background really benefits from having a story
KOANGEL	NU cloudy Ive seen yours, its a good simplistic style
Cloudy	Also just got to dango rank heh
KOANGEL	I dont have a style
Ryuse	My style is changing
Cloudy	Ty!
Ryuse	I just copy whoever I like
KOANGEL	Frr
Ryuse	KO just draw what u like
Dexio	Weee
Cloudy	Also if you saw on insta my most recent post Im trying to change my style some
Dexio	I just draw and then go Im bad
KOANGEL	I like so many styles I cant keep myself on one,
Cloudy	More depth in my stuff
Ryuse	Happens a lot
Ryuse	Keru have u seen the novel artworks for Youjou Senki?
Ryuse	Its awesome
Dexio	Youjo Senki is a top tier isekai
Dexio	None
Ryuse	Hitler loli
KOANGEL	Is it just me or, I cant ever draw simple things, I always add some type of shadow, then complex hair or eyes, then kinda messes it all up
Ryuse	None
Dexio	Me either
Dexio	I suck
Dexio	I find that I do better on actual paper too
Dexio	Also yeah I saw that awhile back, pretty good art
KOANGEL	WOh
Ryuse	Yep
Dexio	The waifubot pics for Tanya are good
Ryuse	U guys wanna see my new favourite style?
Cloudy	Yes
Ryuse	None
Cloudy	OOO
Ryuse	Im gonna go for this
Ryuse	Semi realistic
Ryuse	but anime face
Cloudy	Yeah looks really good
Dexio	Yeah pretty good
Cloudy	.
Cloudy	I also like the blur in the background
Dexio	I myself want a style like my pfp
Dexio	But like I can barely draw as I am now so
Dexio	None
Cloudy	Just keep trying!
Cloudy	You will get there
Dexio	Im sure youve heard this a disgusting amount of times, but practice makes perfect Every artist cuz its true
Cloudy	Yeah it is really
Ryuse	No?
Ryuse	Practice doesnt ..
Ryuse	Its the mindset
Cloudy	I mean you have to practice tho...
Ryuse	I hate doing practice
Ryuse	I just draw
Cloudy	Thats practicing
Cloudy	It doesnt have to be perfect
Ryuse	Practicing is boring
Ryuse	Like
Ryuse	drawing 100 heads
Ryuse	drawing 100 hands
KOANGEL	Yeooo Ima go watercolor bye bye
Ryuse	drawing 100 tits
Ryuse	kek
Pleinair	hmm you dont need to draw 100 heads/hands
Cloudy	I mean you dont have to but it can help
KOANGEL	Yestits
Pleinair	to practice
Ryuse	Mhmm
Ryuse	Like
Ryuse	The wrong kind of practice can just make you waste time
Cloudy	But practicing is pretty much just doing
Pleinair	well you need to know what you need to practice, its easy to have the idea that you need to practice the hand, but where do you start? etc
Ryuse	It starts with fundamentals :3
Ryuse	Forms
Ryuse	Gesture
Ryuse	Perspective
Ryuse	Proportions
Pleinair	well you can always trace to get a feeling of the form
Pleinair	and thats a good way of practicing
Ryuse	Then u break it down
Ryuse	Into the shapes
Ryuse	This is a form study
Ryuse	which is planes
Ryuse	Once u know the form of the hand well
Ryuse	You can shade it
Ryuse	no matter where the light is
Ryuse	I still dont know it
Ryuse	Oh right if I sound obnoxious please do let me know.
Pleinair	well you still technically need to know where the light is
Pleinair	so you can choose to omit details
Ryuse	Yeah for where the highlights and shades are
Ryuse	But u decide where the light source is tho
Ryuse	Like if its far away the shadows and highlight is soft
Ryuse	if its close then its sharp
KELLY	the details
KELLY	None
Pleinair	well ofc you decide where it goes, but most people dont take it into account
Ryuse	None
jiyuxki	can anyone critique my art?
Ryuse	Sure
KELLY	I can try my best
Xennon	hi
Denii	None

obluda	Ok
munzhine	i have lost motivation to draw what do i dooo?
Ryuse	You find motivation
Ryuse	:3
Ryuse	Like
Ryuse	watching animu
Ryuse	reading mango
crestfallen	aww dont lose motivation, i mean you definitely have the skills and is good at drawing but if you lost motivation, maybe you could take a break from drawing and focus on other stuffs? maybe the motivation will come back, im not really sure if my advice works but usually you need to give it time ig
Ryuse	consuming hentai
crestfallen	lmao
Ryuse	That just happens sometimes
Ryuse	I lost my motivation like
Ryuse	a lot of times
Ryuse	Then I imagine posting the finished piece
Ryuse	So its kinda normal to lose motivation at times
munzhine	ah yes reading mangos would help me
munzhine	heh thanks for ze advice uwu

skhema	People, Im thinking about a Twitter account.Would really appreciate some advices for Twitter Accs for artists! I have 0 idea about Twitter. Cause Twitter looks like a sorta chat.
skhema	I hope it is fitting the channel... still an artist topic
BakaBot	basically post your art with a bunch of fitting hashtags and NoHashtags if youre a troll like me and wait for results
KOANGEL	sammme i recently started w twitter hoping to grow
mochinies	Its easier to use twitter for making friends n stuff than IG
skhema	@BakaBot @KOANGEL thank you! I guess its trial error, after all, eh?On IG for example, I have a very good experience on DTIYS and fan art gift for other OC.Was wondering maybe there is something similar on Twitter too.
skhema	Really? Sounds good @mochinies
mochinies	Just start off with like establishing yourself and make friends along the way
KOANGEL	is twitter more with connecting rather posting? ig
KOANGEL	hmm
BakaBot	oh and you can @ people if you draw fanart of their chars
BakaBot	most of them will give you a like or even comment it if its good enough
mochinies	Yeahhh
KOANGEL	ouuu, draw fanart of them i seee
KOANGEL	their characters
mochinies	I think you can approach artist on a more comfortable level on Twitter too compared to IG
BakaBot	i mean if you have a sakura fanart
mochinies	Its just easier to vibe with them
mochinies	I wanna try drawing sakura shes so cute
KOANGEL	IG i pretty professional... yeah
KOANGEL	i might draw sakura too later
BakaBot	sure, fanart of sakura is very welcome if sfw ofc
mochinies	When I see everyones art it makes me go uwu
BakaBot	sooo true
mochinies	I cant draw NSFW even if I tried
BakaBot	like i really feel bad for my drawing of her
KOANGEL	OH! guys im also doing a watercolor of the 3 girls from, get your hands of eizoken
BakaBot	because compared to the others well, it sucks xD

Ryuse	Wat fierce discussion?
mochinies	Asian squAt
Ryuse	Im Asian and its
Ryuse	0149
Ryuse	I was playing magic with friends
mochinies	Dude I tried learning magic it was fun
skhema	Fierce is like fire.We must discuss social like Twitter and IG for artists
mochinies	But I dont have my own cards uU
Ryuse	Oh
KOANGEL	woah where did magic come from
Ryuse	I have my own marketing plan
Ryuse	But its a secret
KOANGEL	ouuu
Pleinair	hm
KOANGEL	secret formula
Ryuse	Well cuz of that Im kinda overrated
Ryuse	and I feel bad for having more followers than artists that are better than me
Pleinair	i dont get the social media aspect
mochinies	I just wanted to make more art friends online thats why I had my socials
mochinies	And then my brother told me to join more servers and invited me here
Ryuse	None
skhema	@KOANGEL Me, as an artist, I support other artists! My secret formula.Im feeling happy like this and we become better together 3
Ryuse	I mostly main deviantart
Ryuse	Yes support each other
Ryuse	Its important
Ryuse	share followers
Ryuse	That way u both get the follower of each other
mochinies	Woah I like your art!
skhema	It sounds naive, buy everyone can discover the secret formula!
Ryuse	Thank you
Ryuse	Hmm
mochinies	My only art friends were my course mates so I was excited to come here and meet more
Ryuse	Maybe
Ryuse	I just do art as a hobby XD
Cloudy	I also dont really have art friends
mochinies	Right? Its so lonely
mochinies	None
Cloudy	Yeah.
skhema	I have no art friends too... but meet some cool people in other countries
Ryuse	I know quite a few
BakaBot	i mean youre active in here with different artists
skhema	Friends can be remote.
BakaBot	guess you could call them friends
Cloudy	Yes I guess so
Cloudy	We just a family in here now
skhema	Some of them I can call friends. Because we share the mindset.
mochinies	I was on another server and it was so harsh
Cloudy	Really?
skhema	Its all about luck sometimes... to find the right place
mochinies	People posting art and others would really critique them but it wasnt like positive reinforcement or anything
KOANGEL	i like it here more, its behind the scenes and alot of new friends
mochinies	I guess the delivery was all wrong but I felt bad
Ryuse	if u guys ask me to critique and be really critical I would grind ur work
KOANGEL	awh mochi im sorry
Ryuse	I would explain what u did good and bad
Ryuse	Cuz its not a critique if u dont say both
skhema	@Ryuse grind my work
mochinies	Yeahh taking it is good but these people went straight hAM
KOANGEL	same, but id critique better
mochinies	Like Oh your handwriting sucks man
Ryuse	Ok guys
KOANGEL	OIJSLKJ okayyy, nooo thats not nice
Ryuse	Lets grind @skhema
skhema	I have no idea how this was meant, but testing
Cloudy	Oh god
Ryuse	Lets grind his work
mochinies	I FEEL MEAN
BakaBot	Round 1
Ryuse	Ok post it here
BakaBot	fight
KOANGEL	wait what
mochinies	I cant
skhema	Thank you for feedback
Ryuse	U guys need to learn how to critique :3
Ryuse	That way u can critique ur works
Ryuse	and produce better stuff
skhema	Its not fight
mochinies	I did a lot of that in my major subs
KOANGEL	wait what, grind meaning
Cloudy	I mean I do it all the time to my own work
mochinies	Yeah me too
Ryuse	Oh its just a figure of speech to just be really critical
Ryuse	The more people critiquing your work the better
mochinies	Plz haze me too then
Ryuse	cuz more eyes
skhema	Im thankful. You know, you can always decide to follow the advice
KOANGEL	ouu okay, i figured
BakaBot	ngl judging own work always ends up in i fked up for me
Ryuse	but u gotta know whether what they say makes sense
Cloudy	I have a hard time being mean
skhema	@KOANGEL dont worry
jayck34	Is there a help channel around ?
BakaBot	theres a mod around
Ryuse	Baka is a mod
BakaBot	where do you need help with
Ryuse	@skhema post the work here to grind
mochinies	I think how a person critiques is useful and just take note. But also not everyone will agree with ur style or have bias so we just take it as is
jayck34	I tried to uh upload my artwork on anime.pic but it wouldnt let me
Ryuse	Im biased for animu
Ryuse	Im an animu artist
Cloudy	Yeah
jayck34	Aparently I have 26 posts but I only have 2 present in my gallery
BakaBot	you mean artwork?
jayck34	None
Cloudy	Animu
mochinies	dude my major teacher hazed anime drawings so bad
jayck34	No no, in anime.pic fir the Sakura contest
skhema	One work? Do you want something finished or the wip? @Ryuse
mochinies	So sad man
KOANGEL	i can critique well, learned alot in class, so ask me if u guys want whenever
Ryuse	If its WIP its really hard to critique
Ryuse	But suggestion could be made
Ryuse	Then its just suggestions and not critique
KOANGEL	tru
skhema	Really? Ok, wait than a finished, moment
BakaBot	i think its better to discuss that in DMs so that we dont spam the channel @jayck34
jayck34	Aight
Ryuse	Baka I cant make an account for the contest
Ryuse	So I cant post
BakaBot	why?
Ryuse	if I finish
Cloudy	Why
Ryuse	I have no idea
Cloudy	You can use your discord?
mochinies	Do you guys ever finish a drawing and get so mad at it after finishing it. You refresh ur eyes and look back at it and ur like EW WTF IS THIS
BakaBot	you can login with discord
Ryuse	Yes
Cloudy	Thats how I did mine
Ryuse	I tried
Cloudy	Yes @mochinies
Cloudy	Hmm
KOANGEL	alr yoo bois, imma hop off i got hw, bye byee
Ryuse	Cya
mochinies	Byeee
Cloudy	Bye bye @KOANGEL
Cloudy	Im not sure why you cant.
Ryuse	I wonder why its not accepting my log in
Ryuse	I tried registering and it doesnt work
Cloudy	Different browser?
Ryuse	Trying to register with chrome
Cloudy	.
Cloudy	I used my safari
Cloudy	But idk actually
Ryuse	Even different browser
mochinies	Just go ham on the admin
mochinies	Jk
skhema	Im lagging sorry
BakaBot	ok ill ask chaga because of that, apperently its a bug for some me included btw
Cloudy	Wow
Ryuse	Oh
Ryuse	What API is being used?
skhema	Its without a chara, I couldnt choose, because characters are not kawaii
skhema	Api?
Ryuse	Hmm whats the story of this piece?
mochinies	Woah thats a cool pic dude
Ryuse	Good use of perspective
Ryuse	Theres usage of both warm and cold colors
Ryuse	warm highlights and cold shade
Ryuse	But Im not sure if its intended for the shades to be weak
Ryuse	like its difficult to discern the values
Ryuse	Except for the inside of the buildings
Ryuse	those are really nice
Ryuse	Im not sure about the focus tho
skhema	Thx dude @mochiniesThe story?, I want to showcase the architecture. Its strict concrete metal but, like not too my depressive as it cyber. @Ryuse but honestly, when people can just walk the bg, its good 3
Ryuse	Walk eh
Ryuse	Then the open stairs is good
Ryuse	cuz my eyes just follows the stairs
Ryuse	I didnt notice the dragonfly until afterwards
mochinies	Oh really? I noticed the dragonflies first
mochinies	I thought they were Cameras at first
skhema	Im a bad artist cause I draw only gifts and for fun. But I draw.Yes, this is right, the insect is way too detailed. Everything too detailed. This is often the problem
Ryuse	Noticed the stairs first for me kek
Ryuse	None
mochinies	Youre not a bad artist, being an artist is a learning process and we only can improve and get better
Ryuse	What made u come to a conclusion youre a bad artist?
mochinies	Its okay too have your style. Everyones will differ from one another
mochinies	And it makes it who you are as an artist
QIQI	@skhema what do u mean bad? youre good
skhema	I see stairs also first!Cause, I am only showing other people my stuff since one year. It was always for paper pile before! Strange. Uhm, nvm
skhema	Nonono, sorry, I am goo
mochinies	Its totally fine man! Trial and error
skhema	Ugh, I sweared myself never say the weakness. Forget please!
skhema	@mochinies I like you mindset
BakaBot	Guys because of the website

Ryuse	Hmm alright
Ryuse	Well once u keep drawing ur eyes will get better
Ryuse	But I dont think Im really a threat tho
Drakeanor	probably anyone can be a threat to me if they re serious
Drakeanor	im an amateur after all
Ryuse	Im just a hobbyist
Ryuse	Still wondering whether Sakurachan has human ears or not
Drakeanor	All I can say now is Sskura fan art is much more better than my current Rem fan art.
Ryuse	Thats good
Ryuse	You made improvements
Drakeanor	she dont have human ear i guess
Ryuse	Well its really late
Ryuse	Im going to sleep

None	Does anyone use Clip studio paint? Im having an issue with registering brushes
None	They wont load/ cant use
mochinies	OH I use CSP
None	@mochinies HOW DO I FIX IT? PLEASE
QIQI	have you drag the brushes that you use into the brush tab? @
None	i have, but it doesnt load
None	i even put them in the correct location and still no results
None	for example, brushes with pen icon, moved it there, nothing shows up
Ryuse	Maybe its just in a different place
Ryuse	instead of brush its pencil
Ryuse	idk
None	/ ive also tried that, but no results.
None	only 20 of the downloads work...
Ryuse	Rip
Ryuse	Try googling
None	i did, no results for my issue, or what im getting is that the downloads arent appearing in the folders.. unsure why i get that but yeah//ff
None	None
Ryuse	Inb4 wrong folder
None	Hmmm I havent checked, Ill do that tomorrow
CheshiroNeko	None
mochinies	After downloading just check in downloaded materials. If it isnt appearing delete the downloaded material and try to redownload it. @ also check ur cloud
mochinies	Also no matter where you put the brush in whatever folder for e.g. you put a pen brush into a pencil folder, it should still work from experience
mochinies	Maybe reinstall your CSP if nothing works out in the end
QIQI	yehh, its kinda work that it doesnt appear.
QIQI	maybe restart your pc or something

Denii	ikr c
Ryuse	I wonder if drak is a guro artist or smthn
Drakeanor	it wasnt a discord server but a game company.
Drakeanor	btw My sakura look more like an adult.
Drakeanor	maybe should change to loli.
Drakeanor	Im not good with drawing a loli thou.
Ryuse	Why would you change to loli? @Drakeanor
Drakeanor	Cuz she is a loli?
Drakeanor	my drawing is too adult compare to her reference
Ryuse	Its fine to draw her as an adult too
Ryuse	@Drakeanor
Drakeanor	Ooohohoh

narumi	bet. will be waitting for it
SaturnTheHybrid	Hi
Ryuse	None
narumi	hi felipe
Ryuse	Is there anything you wanna say like in the picture?
Ryuse	I asked around and it was about roasting calm
Ryuse	saying calm is gae
Ryuse	sake calm
narumi	None
narumi	you asked the wrong channel
Ryuse	Oh yeah definitely
Ryuse	None
narumi	I mean, you should use your own ideas, no hint hint from me
Ryuse	Calm is gae it is
narumi	XD
SaturnTheHybrid	I asked admin for permission if I can post my art
Ryuse	Oh you gotta ask a mod to give you the artist role
Ryuse	@lagoon haiii
SaturnTheHybrid	I asked Calapo
SaturnTheHybrid	Cause he is admin
Ryuse	Oh
Ryuse	Ask @crestfallen
Ryuse	He can give you the role
crestfallen	Oh
crestfallen	Yea
crestfallen	Just dm me your artwork
crestfallen	As proof D
narumi	crest the helper
narumi	owowo
crestfallen	Naruuu
narumi	heya maaate
narumi	long time no see
crestfallen	Damn Naru I mistook another person for you lmao yest
crestfallen	Samee
narumi	eh?
SaturnTheHybrid	Im Nicoanos coffee I am in the art club
Ryuse	Im Ryuse
Ryuse	and I draw art as a hobby
narumi	im naru
narumi	and i do art for suffering living
SaturnTheHybrid	I could never make art for a living
Ryuse	Same XD
narumi	thats what i told myself years ago
narumi	but here i am
narumi	just keep on it
SaturnTheHybrid	To stress ful plus I feel like no one would buy anything from me XD
Ryuse	Im too lazy to do commissions
Ryuse	I dont like taking orders
SaturnTheHybrid	Same
Ryuse	I do what I like kek
Ryuse	Unless
Ryuse	a lot is offered 😉
SaturnTheHybrid	I dont like drawing things that I dont feel like drawing
SaturnTheHybrid	Or else it look horrible
narumi	but its feels great when commissioner actually loves them
Ryuse	Yeah
SaturnTheHybrid	I have done requests
Ryuse	But it also makes me feel guilty at the same time
Ryuse	Like the commissioner loves them
Ryuse	but I dont
Ryuse	So I feel guilty
narumi	well thats normal
narumi	sometimes they dont have the same taste as you
narumi	so
Ryuse	And then I took their money with the work I wasnt satisfied with
Ryuse	They are happy but Im not
Ryuse	Yeah I guess its normal XD
SaturnTheHybrid	Mood
Ryuse	I guess thats the name reason why I dont do commissions now
SaturnTheHybrid	I have only done request cause I doubt any one would buy anything from me
SaturnTheHybrid	Plus I cant draw on a tablet yet
narumi	youre not in economy crisis thats why you dont have to for now XD
SaturnTheHybrid	I can afford one
Ryuse	Lets see
Ryuse	In this viral outbreak
Ryuse	getting commissions will be difficult
Ryuse	First of all
SaturnTheHybrid	Yes
Ryuse	People loses their jobs
Ryuse	plus if they do they would be spending it on essentials and stock up
Ryuse	Secondly, there are more artists
Ryuse	so competition is higher
Ryuse	So you either be better than them
Ryuse	or market as hell
narumi	thats true
narumi	but we dont stack up audience at this time
narumi	we stocked up wince january
narumi	since
Ryuse	Mhmm
Ryuse	But its a bit more difficult cuz of their situation
narumi	some people just take 30 orders and most of them have to wait until the end of the year include me
Ryuse	Oh
Ryuse	Im just struggling to sell adoptables
Ryuse	It took a lot of exposure to get someone to buy it
narumi	for sure it does
Ryuse	Out of 2000 people only 1 paid 50
narumi	you have more peoplel to compete with
narumi	you have to know what your audience really likes and be creative as fuck
narumi	thats harder than taking commission tbh
Ryuse	Mhmm
narumi	well most people enjoy designing so
Ryuse	The dragon girl I did is still not selling
Ryuse	I might lower the price at this rate XD
Ryuse	Yeah maybe we gotta adapt and lower the price
Ryuse	cuz of the situation
narumi	mhm
Ryuse	Welp I guess Ill keep working on Sakurachan now
Ryuse	I think I just ranted XD
Pleinair	seeing other peoples work is important even if it hurts alot
Pleinair	its part of a process
Ryuse	U wanna get hurt?
Ryuse	Look at my work for now
Ryuse	Kek
Pleinair	breaking down what you are seeing, things you could learn from it, analyze
Pleinair	etc
SaturnTheHybrid	But I like to look a human reference not already drawn art
Pleinair	you can do both
Ryuse	Lets see
Ryuse	Felipe
Ryuse	whats your end goal?
Pleinair	you shouldnt limit yourself to just one
Ryuse	I always ask artists this
Ryuse	when they wanna get better
SaturnTheHybrid	Cause thats why I aint good cause I stop drawing for like a month
Ryuse	cuz I think its really important
Ryuse	What?
Ryuse	I havent drawn for a longer time cuz of school
SaturnTheHybrid	Wym
Ryuse	Like what do you want to make
Ryuse	The end goal
SaturnTheHybrid	None
Pleinair	he means, where do you see yourself being satisfied
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	This is what I wanna do in the future
SaturnTheHybrid	Possibly
SaturnTheHybrid	But ik Ill never be able to draw that well
Pleinair	draw little animal gurls?
Pleinair	seems like you doing that already!
Pleinair	jk
Ryuse	Yeah I like drawing cute stuff
Ryuse	Well heres how mine looks for now
SaturnTheHybrid	I already do. use I am a furry
Ryuse	Still need to smooth out the values and make em more defined
Pleinair	doesnt really matter if you are or arent
Ryuse	You see
Ryuse	Good art if objective
Ryuse	taste is subjective
SaturnTheHybrid	See
Ryuse	Yep you really need to learn the basics in my opinion
Pleinair	i mean youll draw many kinds of things
SaturnTheHybrid	I dont wanna draw realistically
Pleinair	thats fine
SaturnTheHybrid	I like my style cartoonish for furrys
SaturnTheHybrid	😰
Pleinair	like theres many things you can learn drawing realistically and turning it into a cartoonish feel
Pleinair	you just have to get like the feel or motion
Pleinair	of what you need
Ryuse	My stand will stay the same kek. Find a goal and learn the basics.
SaturnTheHybrid	You cant expect me to know all this stuff when Im a teenager
Ryuse	Jesus Im also a teenager
Ryuse	what the fuck
Pleinair	hmm well it depends on how you apply yourself
Pleinair	i suppose
Ryuse	Like is everything alright there?
Ryuse	It seems that youre really introverted and have really low self confidence
Ryuse	be more confident man
SaturnTheHybrid	I like being an introvert
Ryuse	So do I
SaturnTheHybrid	I livening being alone for long periods of time with no people around me
Pleinair	like you can do simple things like this
SaturnTheHybrid	I CANT
Pleinair	to get a feel for the style you wanna draw
SaturnTheHybrid	I have not digital tablet
SaturnTheHybrid	And every time I save up money my mom fricking takes it
SaturnTheHybrid	So I cant get one
Pleinair	well i mean put a paper over a picture i suppose
SaturnTheHybrid	Cause were to Piotr
SaturnTheHybrid	And I cant cause I draw in a sketch book
Ryuse	Yep so everything is not alright there
SaturnTheHybrid	What do you mean?!?!😰
SaturnTheHybrid	In meh head?
Ryuse	Nope
SaturnTheHybrid	Then wym?
SaturnTheHybrid	Im confused
Ryuse	I may be wrong
Ryuse	Like your parents taking your money you saved up
Ryuse	is just wrong
SaturnTheHybrid	Well we dont wanna starve
Ryuse	Ok thats more reasonable
Ryuse	Well its up to you to find the way
Ryuse	when theres a will theres a way
Ryuse	Gonna go back to doing my own stuff now kek
SaturnTheHybrid	But sometimes she takes it just so she can buy cigarettes and stuff
Ryuse	Cuz honestly speaking we cant really help you except tell you how to improve.
SaturnTheHybrid	You cant expect every family to afford a hundred to a thousand dollar tablet
Ryuse	Were just people online
SaturnTheHybrid	Idk how to improve I draw every day
SaturnTheHybrid	I improved a lot
SaturnTheHybrid	I can show you my old old art from 6th grade
SaturnTheHybrid	That looks horrible
SaturnTheHybrid	This looks a lot better then back then
SaturnTheHybrid	Sorry Ik I was being annoying 😰😅
SaturnTheHybrid	I hate t self that why I cant make friends easily
SaturnTheHybrid	But for me can you just list out the basics for me please I dont feel like watching a video at 3am in the morning 😅
SaturnTheHybrid	I was trying to say you can expect a fricking middle schooler almost freshman to draw that well
Futulecchi	nah. dont worry too much about it. u draw well
SaturnTheHybrid	No I dont...
Futulecchi	looks like u dont want to improve though
SaturnTheHybrid	I do
Futulecchi	nah u dont
SaturnTheHybrid	How?
SaturnTheHybrid	I try
SaturnTheHybrid	I look at reference
Pleinair	hm
Futulecchi	cause u want to keep in those frames
SaturnTheHybrid	And others ppls art
SaturnTheHybrid	None
Futulecchi	cartoonish
Futulecchi	u dont even want to try watching references from real life
SaturnTheHybrid	I do
Futulecchi	cause u dont want to do realisitc
Futulecchi	well thats what i read
SaturnTheHybrid	Its so boring to
Futulecchi	and understood
Futulecchi	when just simply art is not for u.
SaturnTheHybrid	I look at other furrys art and see how they draw there animations
Pleinair	ofc many things are boring
Futulecchi	cause its boring to u
Futulecchi	people learn new stuff cause they want
Pleinair	but its helps create foundation
SaturnTheHybrid	Well Im only a 8th grader what do you expect
SaturnTheHybrid	Oops
Futulecchi	age doesnt matter honestly
SaturnTheHybrid	I draw every day
Ryuse	Wait
Futulecchi	thats good
Ryuse	8th grader
SaturnTheHybrid	And look at animations a lot to see how people do there movements
Pleinair	anyways
Pleinair	animation is a different discipline
SaturnTheHybrid	And also real life people
Pleinair	than just drawing
SaturnTheHybrid	Its almost the same thing but your just drawing different frames to make it look like move meant when compined together
Futulecchi	when continue doing it. Looks like u do well.
SaturnTheHybrid	None
SaturnTheHybrid	I have not tryed animation yet cause I cant really do that
Futulecchi	i mean looking at animations and things
SaturnTheHybrid	I have nothing to do it on
SaturnTheHybrid	Oh okay
Ryuse	Remember what I said earlier
Ryuse	End goal and basics
Ryuse	Kek
Pleinair	animation is just taking knowledge from drawing basics and learning keyframes and inbetweens
SaturnTheHybrid	I still dont know what the basics are
Ryuse	And finally the great meme
SaturnTheHybrid	I say my art looks good to my self then people say no that looks bad then I try harder but it still ends up looking bad
Pleinair	hmm i mean its a process
Ryuse	Yeah it looks bad to me tbh
Ryuse	ngl
Ryuse	Im brutally honest
SaturnTheHybrid	Ik that
Pleinair	if you wanna get to a certain level, you gotta take the criticism
SaturnTheHybrid	Cause I cant fing draw
SaturnTheHybrid	Well I only get criticism
Futulecchi	u are fine at drawing tho
Pleinair	i cant draw either so dont feel so bad. sits and watches my juniors poop out great line art
SaturnTheHybrid	No I bet you can draw well
Pleinair	everyone show your benchmark art from X yrs ago!
SaturnTheHybrid	None
Pleinair	everyone has art they did 1 yr ago, 2 yrs, 3 yrs, 4yrs, 5yrs, etc
Pleinair	and so on
Ryuse	Ive only been drawing for 2 years
Ryuse	so theres not much
Pleinair	show us that 1st drawing!
Ryuse	Have fun
SaturnTheHybrid	That still looks okay
Futulecchi	nah it looks bad
Ryuse	This too
Ryuse	It certainly is bad kek
Futulecchi	it looks okay but bad
Ryuse	Those were my works back then
Ryuse	last year I made a lot of progress
Futulecchi	fine works
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	Now progression is hard
Pleinair	oh thank god, all my old pics are down the drain
Pleinair	9
Ryuse	I tried experimenting with something last year
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	It was this one
Ryuse	semirealism
SaturnTheHybrid	I dont try hard enough cause my family puts to much expectation thinking ima draw like vango one day when they know I aint gonna
Ryuse	Well
Ryuse	Theres something called the Pygmalion effect
Ryuse	I always have high expectations on me
Ryuse	The Pygmalion effect, or Rosenthal effect, is the phenomenon whereby others expectations of a target person affect the target persons performance.
Ryuse	Meaning the higher their expectation the better u will perform
Ryuse	The expectations come from myself btw
Ryuse	Now to slow it down I think
Ryuse	You dont have to do it like me
Ryuse	find the way you do art
Ryuse	find the way you enjoy doing art
Pleinair	i mean people grow differently
Ryuse	I really liked the thing Im doing so I naturally improved a lot
Pleinair	and depends on their environment/setting and many other factors
Ryuse	I learned things on my own
Pleinair	im slow at improving
SaturnTheHybrid	Every one has different styles
Ryuse	because I like art
Ryuse	Its not about styles
Ryuse	You see how I changed styles right?
SaturnTheHybrid	No I mean other people prefer diffrent types of styles
Ryuse	Mhmm
Ryuse	Doesnt matter
Ryuse	if you like it youll get better at it if you work towards it
SaturnTheHybrid	But your saying I should not draw cartoonish
SaturnTheHybrid	And draw more realistic and anime
Ryuse	yeah good art is objective
Ryuse	Well idk how you interpreted that but its up to you how you improve
SaturnTheHybrid	None
Ryuse	I just shared my experience
Futulecchi	None
mochinies	Hey
Pleinair	i mean adding realism to your cartoonish drawings is also an option
mochinies	None
Pleinair	you dont have to go full realism
Futulecchi	nah felipe u are fine

Futulecchi	for my tastes anything looks fine
Futulecchi	None
Ryuse	But you know

SaturnTheHybrid	I cant sleep
Pleinair	lights them on fire
mochinies	UU old art days
Ryuse	Hmm
mochinies	Not a vibe
None	@ SaturnTheHybrid Some people suggests to do realism because it helps you practice with anatomy and shadings
mochinies	You just learn the basics and branch out from there and find your own style and preferences
SaturnTheHybrid	I do have my own style and preferences
Ryuse	Boom 2 years ago art
SaturnTheHybrid	K?
Ryuse	Kek
None	@ SaturnTheHybrid the points of studying realism is to advance your art
mochinies	Mmmnnn okay, I think you want to vent but you dont want to take what others are saying into consideration.
Futulecchi	Felipe has same taste as me in art
Pleinair	mouse drawing
Futulecchi	not very picky
Futulecchi	hehe
Pleinair	back like 67 yrs ago
Pleinair	orz
Ryuse	@ the point of studying realism is to look at tits
None	Yes, you have your preferences, but its about learning to improve

CyberSpace	Ooo thank yuu
Ryuse	@Panty 3
mochinies	Heyooo
mochinies	None
KOANGEL	Hiii mochiii
KOANGEL	None
mochinies	Hello
mochinies	None
narumi	yo
mochinies	Hi narumi
mochinies	None
Panty	@narumi what stars
EVO	Heya, anyone got any white pen recommendations? I usually work with markers or pencils.
Panty	hmm
Panty	in my opinion. just standard tippex fluid will do. try not to waste money
Panty	what is the pen for?
EVO	Highlights, especially for drawing eyes
Panty	what style?
Panty	on what paper?
EVO	the sketch book im working now is basic print paper i believe, 135gsm, and Im trying not to stick to a specific style much for now
Panty	oh alright
EVO	although im more on cartoon/manga side then realism
Dexio	manga style is epic imo
Dexio	i think semirealistic manga style is good
Panty	then just using tippex is a good starting point to how how you could use white
Panty	start with that
Panty	some amazing people just use tippex
Panty	like yoji shinkawa
EVO	kk. does the nib not matter much?
EVO	and yoji is nuts, wouldnt be suprised if he could draw with mayonnaise
Panty	if youre an amateur like me then nibs types doesnt really do anything but you could get the obvious ones like thick/thin.
Panty	and plus like the tools and shit doesnt even matter
Panty	ur stuff will look good if you know how to use the tools
Panty	like kim jung gi
Ryuse	Do digital :3You dont need to worry about supplies
Dexio	None
Panty	None
Dexio	little different from normal
Dexio	but it definitely is nice
Panty	just way better in my opinion
Dexio	Lots of different options with digital
Panty	but if u like traditional then its okay
Ryuse	Skills are transferable from traditional to digital anyway or vice versa
Panty	but it does take like a week to a month of getting used to
Panty	if ur rich, get those screen ones
Ryuse	You dont really need screen ones tho
Panty	yeah but it helps with the learning curve
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	I see
EVO	I have a wacom tablet and i tried doing a bit but i just start doing art as a subject at skl and so its like i can do it as a hobby and as skl work
KOANGEL	Im so digital I dont have half the brain cell from these traditional works talk
KOANGEL	Lmaooo
KOANGEL	Cool tho,
Panty	doing as a subject at school was like the worst thing ive ever done
EVO	and i feel like i want the basics down on traditional stuff and then go digital
KOANGEL	Thats helps more no thats true for sureee
Panty	nah bro. youre supposed to learn as u go
Ryuse	I didnt take art as a subject in school
Ryuse	But my sister did
Ryuse	And it destroyed her love for art
KOANGEL	Actually I went from drawing on walls as baby then paper then digital yup
Ryuse	Kek
KOANGEL	What? Arts is usually required hm
Panty	@KOANGEL can i see some stuff?
KOANGEL	Ouu, sure in artist check
KOANGEL	Artwork
Panty	my art is too inconsistent to be shown Xdd
Panty	but i would say its like either cartoon or semirealistic
Panty	and a lil bit anime aswell
Pleinair	dont worry my art is inconsistent too!
Ryuse	Showw
Pleinair	o u o
Ryuse	My art is idk
Dexio	mine is bad
Dexio	also dw art takes a long time to get consistent
EVO	is the whole art as a subject thing bad because its ment to force you to draw when you dont want to?
Dexio	consistency comes from muscle memory
Pleinair	hmm i mean, thats every skill kacper
Panty	i wanna take lessons of anatomy and other shit tho to get better but idk where to look
Pleinair	music, writing, exercising etc
Pleinair	you gotta always practice
EVO	ive been keeping what i do for skl and personal very separate and just using things i learn from a side to improve both
KOANGEL	I sent in artwork btw
Pleinair	if you wanna maintain a level where you want to be in
Ryuse	You watch hentai
Ryuse	To improve anatomy
Ryuse	Ez
KOANGEL	No style but its anime overall, I do realism too but, sketches
KOANGEL	its helpful thooo ryuse ngl
Panty	dude i never have any ideas of what to draw
Ryuse	Want to learn how to draw blood?
Ryuse	Stab someone
KOANGEL	Ouuu
KOANGEL	oh
KOANGEL	OH
EVO	got no one to stab
EVO	too lonely
Ryuse	Yourself is always an option :3
KOANGEL	Hell yeah
Panty	the one thing that i cant draw women. its like wtf everything looks wrong
Ryuse	Youre someone
Ryuse	I only draw women
KOANGEL	Wow rly men are hard for me
KOANGEL	Well I can do it but I often do women
KOANGEL	Curved or no curves
Panty	i can never draw boobs thighs and legs for girls
Panty	and dont get me started on the face
Panty	Xddd
Dexio	bruh
Dexio	i cant draw either
Ryuse	Same
Pleinair	i dont draw women orz
Panty	however i draw hands like a fucking pro somehow
Pleinair	i draw monsters!
Ryuse	Lemme seee
Ryuse	The hands
Pleinair	ya show us them hands
KOANGEL	Woaahhh I tried monsters but too much creativity needed for me
Panty	@KOANGEL if u like cyber shit look up Death stranding and Cyberpunk2077
Panty	i always draw them over the top
Ryuse	Cyber reminds me of tron
Dexio	my last digital drawing
Dexio	was
KOANGEL	👀sure, I do cyber not too much bc holy fuck its hard, only when Im inspired
Ryuse	Kek

KOANGEL	Wait I do steampunk a bit differently

Ryuse	I like drawing my own original species
Ryuse	Its so simple to do

Dexio	im known to be a waste of space
Dexio	10/10
Dexio	fish looks good
Ryuse	Im looking for ways to improve it
Dexio	yum
Panty	@Ryuse think about the lighting
Panty	for me it looks like its everywhere
Panty	theres no consistent shadows
EVO	character feels flat compared to the background
Ryuse	Hmm I see
Ryuse	Alright
Panty	plus glass is alil bit opaque not clear
KOANGEL	Coloring is amazing, and very clean, background and overall look is really put on, but Id say it feels stiff but you can overcome it with hard work on final lighting etc and glares!
Panty	god rays are too sharp
Panty	ambient occlusion is good tho
EVO	conclusion?
Panty	Xddd
EVO	lmao
Ryuse	Basically reflected light
Ryuse	Kek
narumi	@narumi what stars@Panty?

EVO	Welp I know what to do@Ryuse ik we all told u shit u can do better but tbh it already looks amazing
Dexio	ive played games for a long time and im bad
Panty	laughs in 11 years of fps games
Ryuse	None

Panty	None
Ryuse	Also brush up on anatomy

Panty	work on perspective
Ryuse	Anatomy and proportions are 2 different things
Panty	adn depth
KOANGEL	Ooouu I though the same, but for some reason I like the same size cell lines, I might become my style
KOANGEL	Also Ill check on that
Ryuse	After u add line weight variation
Ryuse	Color ur lines
Panty	it shouldnt become it tbh i dont know any artist with that
Mochi	colored lines

Storm	@SomeRandomDude See, I at least know now, you cant be that wise man that said Ok... for 3 different reasons

Drakeanor	When I become pro, I will start my own patreon or twitch
mart	WHEREE
Drakeanor	But for now just learn new things and draw for fun
Drakeanor	Enjoy the dream of become artist.
shaeru.in	heeerrre
Pleinair	pretty cute!
shaeru.in	aaa thank u
Drakeanor	Am I the only one who draw a nee chan?
Drakeanor	Every one draw loli
Drakeanor	None
shaeru.in	mmmaybe
shaeru.in	I think there were some entries that were neechan like
mart	OHMYGOD THATS SO FUCINGNGN GOOODD
mart	HOW THE HELL DO YOU DO THSTSGCBV
shaeru.in	Hmmm slap some colors and multiple layers?
Ryuse	@Drakeanor oh you do commissions?
Ryuse	Wheres your comm sheet
Drakeanor	I dont have that
Ryuse	Then how will customers know your rates?
Drakeanor	I only received money 1 time
Ryuse	I see
Drakeanor	Negotiation
shaeru.in	Oh speaking of commissions Ryuse, do u usually make your own ToS? or we can copy them from other artists?
mart	slap some colors
Ryuse	I have my own TOS that I copied from someone and modified
shaeru.in	ooohh
Drakeanor	Im an amateur so most people dont want to buy my drawing
Drakeanor	They dont trust me that much.
Ryuse	Here are some essentials
Drakeanor	NEED TO DRAW MORE.
shaeru.in	Woah a doc Thankiieeesss
Ryuse	Yep
Ryuse	You gotta know how invoices work
Ryuse	but dont worry it aint that complex
mart	your art is great drake
Ryuse	Drak what you need is marketing
shaeru.in	Aighty then Imma save them.
Ryuse	Also how does S20 for a full body sound to you?
Ryuse	Like a full body drawing
mart	to me it sounds good
Drakeanor	Seem good
mart	since you draw really well
Ryuse	and its colored
Drakeanor	Wait until
mart	ya gud price
Drakeanor	I post my Sakura fan art
shaeru.in	Pricing
mart	im looking forward to it drake!
shaeru.in	me tooo
Ryuse	I might commission you for a full body piece in the future drak
Drakeanor	Ok
Ryuse	For S20
Ryuse	Do you have paypal?
Pleinair	depends
Pleinair	20 can be pretty low!
Ryuse	Mhmm
Pleinair	even for a full body
shaeru.in	Depends on the minimum wage in your country i think.
Drakeanor	In condition that I will post in my social platforms
Ryuse	But to get started u need to go low first
Ryuse	Mhmm
Drakeanor	I want to show off my skill
Ryuse	Also another condition is that I can resell it
Pleinair	i mean it depends how much you think your time/work is worth
Ryuse	Im selling it as an adoptable
Drakeanor	I see.
shaeru.in	I agree with Ryu tho. Start with low, if the demand increases, increase your price as well
Ryuse	What do you say?
Drakeanor	Ok
Ryuse	Alright
Ryuse	But remember in negotiations you need to ask questions
Ryuse	I already scammed you
Ryuse	like ffs
shaeru.in	wat
Ryuse	be more careful
Ryuse	I couldve sold his S20 for 30
Ryuse	because I have bigger audience
shaeru.in	oh
mart	i dont think the wage in your country should affect you
Ryuse	But heres the thing
mart	other artists prices should
Ryuse	The S20 aint that bad
Ryuse	because I have a big audience
mart	it really isnt
Ryuse	about 5k
Ryuse	So its exposure
Ryuse	but its useless if exposure doesnt work for u
shaeru.in	mhm
Ryuse	I give credits to the one that created the art for the adoptable
Ryuse	and if the adoptable sells Ill commission them again
Ryuse	Its a steady flow of job
Ryuse	Im the one taking the risk tho
Ryuse	cuz if it didnt sell Ill lose money
mart	oboi
mart	art is complicated
Ryuse	No its not :3
shaeru.in	Marketing is complicated
Ryuse	Im trying to turn it into a business thats why
Storm	These people skilled and complicated
Ryuse	Ive commissioned 2 artists to draw me adoptables
Ryuse	None
mart	what are adoptables again
Ryuse	Like this one
shaeru.in	000 cuuute
Ryuse	Ive commissioned the artist for 15
Ryuse	I did some changes
Ryuse	I sold this for 19
shaeru.in	OCs but like, u sell.
mart	o
Ryuse	So I made a S4 profit
mart	this is too complicated for me
Ryuse	but I actually made S3 profit cuz paypal tool some
Storm	How long does it usually take you to make a good piece?
Drakeanor	But I will sign in my name right
Ryuse	Nope
Ryuse	Adoptables you dont sign your name on the character

narumi	yo whatsup with that
Drakeanor	Do you guys submit your work with jpg or png type?
mart	go png @Drakeanor
mart	you dont want your pic losing quality
mart	which is what jpg does
Ryuse	Png
Ryuse	Png best
Ryuse	Jpg or jpeg sux
mart	it does
mart	compression destroys quality
mart	that a nono
Ryuse	Go svg if u can :3
Ryuse	Svg means it can be as big as necessary
Ryuse	SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic
mart	thats the same as png isnt it?
Ryuse	Nope
Ryuse	Its vectors
Ryuse	Meaning it can be any size
mart	png retains the file size and doesnt make it smalled tho
Ryuse	Usually used for logos
Ryuse	Ok svg means
Ryuse	You can go to 1m x 1m pixels
Ryuse	Or more
Ryuse	But png is best for illustrations
mart	ive never seen an svg file
mart	is it new? or just not as used
Ryuse	Hmm
Ryuse	Just not as used
Ryuse	Its more for vectors and logos
mart	i sed
mart	see
Ryuse	But imagine illustrations being SVG file

imleebutwhoasked	H,i Im lee and Im starting a gaming team. We are called Team.Fiery. We have everything that we need. We have bots and competitive players but we need more. And the reason for me being in the art chat is so we can find a talented artist who is willing to help us on our journey. We have a graphics art team but it is fairly small but they are great artist.
Ryuse	So hows the pay?
Leaf	xD
Cloudy	Wow
Leaf	@Chaga i guess im not the only one
Ryuse	Thats always the first thing to ask :3
imleebutwhoasked	well since we just started you will have to talk to the payment manager
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	Well we need more details about what the artist will do
imleebutwhoasked	the artist well be making logos
imleebutwhoasked	fofr each teawm
imleebutwhoasked	all art styles are allowed
Ryuse	Logos eh
imleebutwhoasked	we have a csgo team
Ryuse	There has been a surplus of logo requests lately
Ryuse	I wonder whats happening
imleebutwhoasked	a rainbow six team
imleebutwhoasked	and a fortnite team
imleebutwhoasked	we area also trying to get into the valorant team
imleebutwhoasked	or scenery
imleebutwhoasked	but everything is up to the artist
Cloudy	Arent you not suppose to advertise ...

imleebutwhoasked	oh im sorry i did not know i will be on my way if im troubling you
Cloudy	In the guidelines
Ryuse	Hmm I see
imleebutwhoasked	oh im sorry
Ryuse	@imleebutwhoasked Can you show us examples of quality youre looking for and the range?
Ryuse	Just curious
imleebutwhoasked	be more specific
Ryuse	Quality of pieces
Ryuse	like example of artworks
Ryuse	and price range youre offering
Ryuse	cuz I might know a place for you
Ryuse	where you can find a lot of artists
Ryuse	Also can I see your Teams social media?
imleebutwhoasked	20 to 30 bucks but we need well we need some kinda clout we also content creators
imleebutwhoasked	all artwork needs to be digital
Ryuse	2030 bucks seems to be a small price for a commercial work
imleebutwhoasked	wel were are a small team so its a reasonable price for us
Ryuse	I see
Ryuse	But market prices aint like that unfortunately
Ryuse	I do hope you find an artist
imleebutwhoasked	well thx for hearing me out
Ryuse	No problem
Yetimyth	Why search for an artist when you can become one?
Ryuse	Logos usually cost 200
Ryuse	USD
Leaf	cause not everyone has that much time
Leaf	and talent
Leaf	simple as that
Yetimyth	True
Yetimyth	But more expensive
Leaf	true true
Leaf	thats why artist who do it just for fun are the best xDbut well its understandable if they want a lot of money
Leaf	Its very time consuming in the end
imleebutwhoasked	well, yoroshiku onegai shimasu peice👍 😋
imleebutwhoasked	also they will have a team at there disposal
Yetimyth	And the time you spend on the one you make can be well worth it especially since you can save money
Leaf	but first you need to train that skill
Leaf	and that can take years
imleebutwhoasked	all of the art members are in art school so we are good on that
imleebutwhoasked	brb
imleebutwhoasked	None
Yetimyth	It can also take a very short time if you spend enough time nurturing that skill and practicing it a lot
imleebutwhoasked	thats the leaders art
Ryuse	I see
shaeru.in	That looks so coooll 0000
Yetimyth	If you work hard enough you will be proud of yourself
Ryuse	I havent gone to art school but Ive been doing commissions for quite a while now
Ryuse	so I kinda know the art market by a bit
shaeru.in	Same I stopped accepting commishes tho ..
Yetimyth	Pick your battles
Leaf	well i think the hardest part isnt swinging the pencil , its more like the imagination of what you draw
Ryuse	Yep
Ryuse	I stopped accepting commissions
Ryuse	I sell characters and designs now
shaeru.in	Got scared so Ill take a very long break for now.
Ryuse	I decided to draw Sakura for fun
Ryuse	and joined the contest
shaeru.in	Nice
Yetimyth	That is what all artists face every second
Leaf	xd
Ryuse	Oh trust me
imleebutwhoasked	well thanks for all of your help
Ryuse	I spend more time thinking than actually drawing
Ryuse	Then asking for feedback
shaeru.in	Still working on the animation meme
Ryuse	I wish you luck in your endevours Lee
Leaf	well the artist i wanted to buy a character design from
shaeru.in	Oh I feel that but I ended up being artblocked reee so I just doodle whatever.
Yetimyth	And they also face trying to put their ideas on the page the way they want
imleebutwhoasked	same to you and your future
Leaf	about 800 euro for a design
Ryuse	Wow
Ryuse	I only sell for like 4060
Ryuse	USD
Yetimyth	Artblocked? Wats dat?
Ryuse	If chibi then its cheaper
Ryuse	Commissions will cost more
Leaf	well she was my dream artist kinda
Ryuse	Ah
Leaf	soo i tried to ask , guess was a mistake
imleebutwhoasked	Konban wa,good evening
shaeru.in	Its like writers block but art when you cant draw anything right or somethin.
imleebutwhoasked	bye
Ryuse	If she has the audience to back up the price its understandable
Yetimyth	Oh yeah
Ryuse	I only have 5k followers on DA and Im struggling to sell XD
Ryuse	Most that followed me follow for my illustrations
shaeru.in	Kek I only have a hundred
Leaf	yeah quite a few followers , an own website ,high rank on several art contest
Ryuse	Whew
shaeru.in	But thats fine because Im still having fun drawing
Ryuse	Mhmm
Ryuse	It takes time
Ryuse	Growth is exponential
Leaf	i always tried to ask people on pixiv
Ryuse	I hope I make it to the top 3 in the Sakura contest tho
Leaf	but i never get a reply
Leaf	lmao
Ryuse	Oh
Leaf	most cant english xd
Ryuse	I once got into the pixiv rankings
shaeru.in	Yeah I can see that in pixiv XDDD
Ryuse	for amateur artists kek
shaeru.in	SAAAMMEE OMG
Ryuse	It was a fanart
Ryuse	Pixiv is good if you draw a lot of fanarts
Leaf	well for anime art pixiv is the greatest place
shaeru.in	true that
Leaf	to find directly the artist aswell
Ryuse	I draw original stuff and it doesnt seem to get noticed well
Ryuse	So my Sakura drawing wont be seen much
shaeru.in	mhm
Leaf	but you got 132k page views
Leaf	that isnt bad
Ryuse	Mhmm
Ryuse	on DA
Leaf	your name in one of our mutual servers
Leaf	thats how i found you
Leaf	lmao
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	I was looking for servers to advertise
shaeru.in	oh
Ryuse	But I got lazy
Leaf	xD
Ryuse	and didnt quit
Leaf	marketing is the most important thing in the internet
Ryuse	so the servers are just sitting there
Ryuse	Mhmm
Ryuse	Marketing is often overlooked
Leaf	without it we all wouldnt be here
Ryuse	Yes
Leaf	rip chagas money
Ryuse	Oh god
Ryuse	Who do you think will claim the 120?
Ryuse	Its quite hard for me to decide when I try to look at them objectively
Leaf	well i guess it will be rose
Ryuse	Rose eh
Ryuse	I find Dumps one to be pretty good tho
Leaf	the one with the fish?
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	This one
Ryuse	Oh god the image is big
Leaf	ah yeah
Leaf	thats not bad aswell
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	This one too
Leaf	None
Leaf	that one aswell
Ryuse	Hmm that looks good
Ryuse	Didnt really catch my eye tho
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	This one would really be great once the artist learns how to draw backgrounds
Leaf	indeed
Ryuse	I just hope mine makes it to the top 3 kek
Leaf	xD
Leaf	good luck
Ryuse	You saw mine right?
Leaf	yeah
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	Im trying to slowly bring 2D to 3D
Leaf	can notice that xD
Ryuse	Hmm
Leaf	it did catch my eye, but how to say
Leaf	she kinda doesnt look like the og sakura anymore
Leaf	if you get me
Ryuse	Ohh
Leaf	dunno how to explain lmao
Ryuse	Is it the fur?
Leaf	yeah
Ryuse	I gave her the fur on her kimono
Ryuse	so her kimono would be a coming of age kimono
Ryuse	so shes a legal loli
Ryuse	:3
Leaf	None
Ryuse	Yep
Leaf	well played
Ryuse	Thats the intention
Ryuse	To show shes legal
Ryuse	None
Leaf	chaga would never use a illegal loli as a server mascot
Leaf	None
Ryuse	None
Leaf	None
Ryuse	I tried inserting memes inside the drawing
Leaf	what kind of memes
Ryuse	The thing I like about Roses drawing is their technical skill
Ryuse	I can tell its practiced
Ryuse	The shading is smooth kek
Leaf	aswell as the details
Ryuse	Wait
Ryuse	Lemme show u the memes
Leaf	lmao
Ryuse	I quoted em
Leaf	None
Leaf	i changed my mind
Leaf	you deserve first place
Ryuse	Maybe kek
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	These two are quite similar but I like Dumps one more
Leaf	thats eyecatching cause of the shiny colors
Ryuse	Yes
Ryuse	Dumps one seems more polished
Leaf	but well i prefer dumb ones in that case
Ryuse	Same
Ryuse	Sugoitacions colors are too saturated imo
Ryuse	Dumps one are just the right saturation kek
Ryuse	Meanwhile this gives me Touhou Reimu vibes.
Ryuse	I think thats all my thoughts for the contest works. Thank you for listening to me kek
Leaf	None
DonnyArts	im not that good at making backgrounds
DonnyArts	im more in it to make characters

akkey	i dont have any motivation in making arts😔
akkey	i wanna quit
Ryuse	How come?
akkey	idkk im slowly losing interest
None	i get that feeling..
None	/
akkey	andd im starting to hatee my artt
akkey	yea right?
None	It gets rlly tiresome and sometimes... its hard competing with others
None	😮 but i totally get how u feel, that shouldnt stop u from drawing tho take a hiatus if u need to
akkey	i already
Ryuse	Hmm
None	well, what motivated you to draw?
Ryuse	I wont stop you if you want to quit art
Ryuse	but you should at least know why you quit
Ryuse	like clearly reflect
None	ryuse is right
akkey	iddkkk thoo i already took 2 months break
akkey	and started posting again last week
akkey	buttt went down again
None	hiroaki, why do you do art?
None	😮 serious question
akkey	its my hobby way back 2019 summer and my parents want me to take fine arts in college
None	did school stress u out
akkey	yeaa kindaa,, i took drafting last year
akkey	anddd i gott low grades but i still passed
None	hmmm... do u think school started to affect your interest in art
akkey	maybe tho, or my insecurities
None	😮 well, as ryuse stated, think thoroughly about it
Ryuse	I see
Ryuse	Well that happened to my sister
Ryuse	She took art as a subject in school cuz she loved it
Ryuse	school killed her love for art
Ryuse	So I try to separate hobby from work
Ryuse	I realised that the sayingDo what you love, and youll never work another day in your life.nis bullshit kek
akkey	yee i expect that when i took art subject itll improve my skill and i can draw freely but this boomer all she do is discuss and made us do the architectural something
akkey	like bitch,,, i dont want to be architect or engineer
Ryuse	Personally I think what they are teaching is good
Ryuse	Its very practical
Ryuse	and makes you employable
Ryuse	Its not that you hate art
Ryuse	You hate school
akkey	noo,, all of my classmate hates her because we didnt even do some plates or portfolio
Ryuse	I see XD
Ryuse	There we go
Ryuse	I think you found the source
Pleinair	hating your art?
Ryuse	Nah they just dont like their teacher
Ryuse	which creeped up into hating art
Pleinair	oh thats school in general
Ryuse	Mhmm
Pleinair	your gonna find prof/teaches u hate
Ryuse	I had a great teacher when I took a subject
Ryuse	made me love the subject
Dump	Heyy hey
Dump	I dont draw from my imagination tho
Dump	Cause I succ
Dump	And yeah love it or hate it
Pleinair	hmm many people cant
Pleinair	cuz freedrawing takes practice
Dump	Yepp
Dump	Life time practice
Ryuse	Its a hit or miss tbh
Ryuse	For me
mart	if only i knew how to draw even with references
mart	None
Dump	I use references tho
Ryuse	I use a lot of references 😄
mart	ye but i cant even draw with these
Dump	I mean you dont need to master techniques tho
Dump	Just copy copy copy
Pleinair	theres nothing wrong with references
Delcina	who should i draw?
Ryuse	Hentai
Dump	Hmmm
Delcina	Hentai?
Dump	Let me give you challenge
Delcina	no.
Dump	Here try this
Delcina	what is that?
Dump	Its a creative thought
Ryuse	Well for me I try to draw what gives me the most benefit
Ryuse	Like monetary or clout
Delcina	for beginners?
Dump	Yepo
Delcina	I should say im not really a beginner.
Ryuse	Its just an idea generator
Delcina	oh ok.
Dump	Beginner or professional we still win
Delcina	what app?
Dump	Uhhh
Dump	Draw it
Dump	Its an idea generator that can help you draw from imagination
Dump	Or references
Delcina	pick an anime character you want me to draw.
Dump	Fanart?
Dump	Demon slayer
Delcina	yes.
Ryuse	Draw my OC :3
Delcina	what character?

Delcina	Corona chan?
Ryuse	Corona Viruschan
Delcina	what does corona chan look like?
Ryuse	Hmm
Ryuse	You decide
Ryuse	Heres my interpretation of her
Ryuse	None
Pleinair	hm
Delcina	ok ok.
Delcina	nice drawing.
Ryuse	Like you do your own design
Delcina	sure ill try.
Ryuse	Good luck!
Delcina	bye bye stay active later.
Delcina	should i do digital art or drawing @Ryuse?
Pleinair	you can do both!
Ryuse	Personally I think you should do which one you want
Delcina	drawing it is.
Dump	Depends on you
Dump	Which is more comfortable
Dump	Anyways how do I put my artwork on insta
Dump	Im a boomer rip
Pleinair	huh?
Pleinair	thats not how boomer werks
Dump	yeet
Dump	How do I put my work on sakura official insta?
Ryuse	I have no idea
Dump	Rip
Dump	Welp

KOANGEL	Took me a while but
KOANGEL	I had to like, post on animepics somth here Ill send the link, and I talked with chaga, he runs the IG
Pleinair	hm?
KOANGEL	Yeah its in 🔔announcements
KOANGEL	Last messg
Ryuse	Do u guys prefer the top or the bottom one?
Dump	Wait you can still edit your submission?
Ryuse	I asked
Dump	Oohh
Dump	Interesting
KOANGEL	First, but for some reason the second is rly nice without lights
Dump	I pick bottom
Dump	Good saturated lights
Dump	Thicc shadow lines
KOANGEL	Oh it is there mb I couldnt see Im so f tired lmaooo
KOANGEL	Bottom yes
Dump	Use your advantage on backgrounds
Ryuse	Kek
Dump	Like less details if the object is far away
Ryuse	My goal is to make it eye catching
Dump	Ahhh eye catching i see
Ryuse	The one I submitted is quite bland kek
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	This one
Dump	Add blur effect
Ryuse	Already did
Ryuse	For the BG
Dump	Add it more
Dump	Dont make the background stand out
Dump	But the character itself
Dump	And edit it using filters
Dump	Adjust the density of lights around her
Ryuse	Lemme try kek
Dump	Apply environmental lights around sakura
Dump	And there ya go
Ryuse	I only added very subtle ones
Ryuse	Like oranges
Dump	Make it sharp
Dump	Dont use airbrush
Dump	Use watercolor and opacity 100
Dump	Just a lil bit over the edge
Ryuse	Oh youre talking about rimlight
Dump	Yepp
Dump	Rim lights
Ryuse	Kek
Dump	and yeah
Dump	Never use airbrush
Dump	Nor eraser for soft lines
Dump	Use water color but transparent
KOANGEL	@FuyuHaruu what do you digitally draw on atm? Also what I did was traditional but I do digital as much now too
Dump	digital
Dump	My hands succ at trad
FinalSemester	I dont think mine made it in but not like it had any chance of winning XD
FinalSemester	None
Dump	Dont worry
Dump	Eveyone wins
Dump	Portfolio
FinalSemester	None
Ryuse	Kek I think I lost details somewhere
Ryuse	Bottom is before
Dump	Theree ya go
Dump	Now that is eye catching
Ryuse	Which one?
Dump	The top is more now eye catching
Dump	Your welcome lmao
Ryuse	Hmm
Ryuse	Alright kek
Ryuse	Ty
Dump	Ohh I forgot
Dump	Add details to the object near at the character
Dump	Like the shadows
Dump	Make it sharp
Dump	Dont make the near objects shadows blurry
Dump	Anyways yeah
Ryuse	alright
Ryuse	lets see what happens
Dump	Okay I wanna see saw
Dump	After the background is donr
Dump	Make sure your character doesnt get any lighter tones
Dump	It means darken sakura a little bit
Dump	So it contrast the backgrounds lightning and sakuras
Ryuse	I see
Ryuse	Lemme do adjustments
Dump	B Sakuras backF Sakuras frontSmall circle rim lights
Dump	Suree
Dump	Wait imma charge
AmyMagiCat	Im confused?
AmyMagiCat	I feel like I made Sakura a bit older.
AmyMagiCat	I didnt see much people do Fireworks much... So, I added fire works which dont fit well./
AmyMagiCat	Hmm
Dump	Oof
AmyMagiCat	Ill attach an image for fun.
AmyMagiCat	Oh hey Dump!
Dump	Heyy hey

Chaga	@AmyMagiCat yw I seen you talking earlier and recognized your name
AmyMagiCat	Oh, thank you!
Ryuse	Top or bottom?
cat🐱	top
cat🐱	None
Ryuse	I see
Empty0Smile	I would say the bottom
Ryuse	Naruhodo
Ryuse	Why top @waaa is cat🐱?
Ryuse	and why bottom @Empty0Smile?
cat🐱	the top looks a bit brighter and seems like focus on sakura so much but the bottom one more darker and i keep taking my eye to the girl with the kimono behind sakura
cat🐱	None
crestfallen	Yes top
cat🐱	the girl with the kimono behind sakura quite eye catching
cat🐱	None
Empty0Smile	@Ryuse The top looks like its more focused the the face and a lot brighter, and the bottom does show the background so it does tell her surrounding and the light is better
Empty0Smile	it does depend on what youre trying to show in the drawing
Ryuse	Naruhodo
Ryuse	So its like
Ryuse	A choice between realism or appeal
Empty0Smile	Yes
cat🐱	i think
cat🐱	None
Ryuse	Lets try a 3rd option
Ryuse	Bright and shows the bg
cat🐱	hmmm
cat🐱	yesh better
cat🐱	None
Ryuse	Hmm alright
Empty0Smile	I would go for the the third option
Ryuse	Got it
Ryuse	Thank you guys for your feedback 😄
cat🐱	your welcomeee
cat🐱	None
Empty0Smile	youre welcome and great art
Dump	Ohh wait I noticed you added some petals
Dump	Good job 👌
Ryuse	They are more prominent now
Ryuse	They were lower opacity before
Dump	Ahh yeahh
Dump	I also noticed you added a frame tho
CapoKey	so many great artists here

Ryuse	Top or bottom?
Armannamra	cute
Mochi	Top
Ryuse	Why top?
Ryuse	@Mochi
CapoKey	hard choice tbh
CapoKey	bottom looks mor interesting imo
CapoKey	but i think its zoomed in too much?
Mochi	It is
Mochi	The zoom makes it worse
Ryuse	Hmm
Ryuse	Lets try zooming out
Dump	Top
Ryuse	@Dump why top?
Dump	Bottom looks good too but dont rotate the image lmao
Ryuse	How come?
Dump	Idk it looks weird to me
Ryuse	Naruhodo
Ryuse	Do you feel unease?
Dump	Ahhh Oof
Ryuse	Dutch angles is what they call it kek
Dump	None
Dump	Dutch angles eh
Dump	Yeahh but nah
Dump	Use that if your character is on another position
Dump	Or full body on a small ant view
Ryuse	Gonna experiment with the tilts
Ryuse	I think the tilt is more interesting kek
Ryuse	@Mochi @CapoKey what do you think?
Ryuse	This one is zoomed out
Ryuse	Lets try this one
Ryuse	Oh god discord set it in the wrong order
CapoKey	yeah that looks better
CapoKey	i assume the grey borders are not meant to be there
Ryuse	Yeah
Ryuse	Im just screenshotting
CapoKey	very cute art btw
Ryuse	Thank you XD
Ryuse	@Chaga how do I change my submission
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	Im choosing to change my submission to this one
Junior	None
Chaga	@Ryuse honestly idk maybe if I reject the first one that would help
Chaga	try now
Ryuse	Lemme try
Ryuse	@Chaga yeah when I press submit it doesnt show pending. I might have to make a different account
Chaga	yeah or I can try and contact the person that owns the website to remove manually later
Ryuse	Hmm I see
Ryuse	So Ill try with another account or do I wait for you to contact the person?
Chaga	but regardless we will just judge somewhere else anyways and I wont use the old one I will just use the new one
Ryuse	Ah alright
Chaga	yeah let me try to talk to them might be awhile though

KOANGEL	Yep
KOANGEL	500xp
shaeru.in	oh crap
GraysOn	@PseudoJuno I havent touched Krita much and its been awhile, but I think you have to hold shift and drag the frame to the desired slot. I could be totally wrong, though. Im sure if you google it youll get an immediate answer.And I realize this response is hours late and you might have solved the problem already. Sorry!
pachi	Hi
PseudoJuno	Im still new to krita but what Im trying to do exactly is use the outline selection tool then copy paste it into the next frame. This is a gif im editing.
Pleinair	hm
Pleinair	when you make a new frame
Pleinair	it should have your previous frame saved onto your new frame

cat🐱	Damnn
QIQI	hemm @Pleinair @Aaliyajajaja I did tried to engage in a different coloring style, more crosshatching rather then blending but yeh., I choose different approach on the color too
Pleinair	hm, i mean kikis present work, shows that understanding of hard light even more by presenting a glimmer and a more darker shadow on the hair, ofc imo your adjusting and exploring techniques.
QIQI	true true
Pleinair	cuz a different stylization in rendering would be much more drastic in how you apply the tones and lighting imo
Pleinair	like aiming for a realistic look vs a more quick and simple with hardcolors
Aaliyajajaja	Ah I see.
QIQI	tones and shades are my weakness. Imjust bad at choosing the right one. I notice that when Im looking at my old drawing,the color too vibrant sometime that it doesnt look natural. So I tried to go with a more again idk the word but like pale ish color. But like Cat said maybe I should add more shade on the skin to give more depth
Pleinair	ya i feel ya pal! been experimenting with colors lately
Pleinair	you can add a multiply layer
Pleinair	to do the extra tone
QIQI	I saw some artist do that, but i just dont understand how it work.
QIQI	the color doesnt show much when I change it to multiply
Aaliyajajaja	I dont struggle with shades and tones as much because I mostly use watercolor and I think thats fairly easy.
Pleinair	are you using the same color?
QIQI	@Aaliyajajaja oh you more to traditional?
Pleinair	when using a mulitply layer
QIQI	@Pleinair nope a different shade ofcourse
QIQI	do I need to use the same color?
Pleinair	different layer, use same color
Ryuse	@QIQI what art style are you aiming for?
QIQI	ouh really
Aaliyajajaja	@QIQI been using it for 8 years almost :3
QIQI	me? Oh my aim are very high
Ryuse	Example?
QIQI	@Aaliyajajaja woww, I remember I was so into watercolor and color pencil back then, but now that I got my tablet, I abandon traditional and I now I have to restart all over again cause my skills are agone.
Aaliyajajaja	I absolutely cannot use digital lmao
QIQI	example, hemmm maybe mmimmzel or ryota. If you look at how they approach their artwork, they use a more pale kinda color, but have this shiny bit shade that idk how the heck they do it.
QIQI	like around the hair or eyes. I know its multiply or glow or overlay someth,.. but I can never figure out how to make it look natural
Pleinair	hmm ya i think colors are one of my weaknesses as well
Ryuse	Oh
Pleinair	im not consistent with everything on the canvas
Ryuse	Can I see a piece?
Ryuse	Cuz I believe having a clear goal in art will help you improve fast
QIQI	yeh I know that, Im an art student and we need alot of reference from any of our favorite artists. and I mean alot that we have a book full of just reference pictures from google. lmao.
Ryuse	Hmm I see
Ryuse	I think I know what style youre aiming for now
QIQI	yeh, I change my artstyle every 35months, till I figure out my own artstyle.
QIQI	@Ryuse yeh, like the 2 artists that I mention
Pleinair	imo you could always just change it every moment, depending on what content/theme you are going for
OPEN	ay, speaking of style. could someone take a look at some of my pieces?idk what style id fall under
QIQI	It take time but Im sure Ill get there one day, i just started digitally december last year anyway
Pleinair	sure
Pleinair	@Gerkek Commissions OPEN
QIQI	@Pleinair trueee
Ryuse	Anime probably
Pleinair	that way kiki, you can pick things you like and wanna express/emphasize
Pleinair	well anime has many styles
Pleinair	tbf
OPEN	ill dm ya 😄
Pleinair	anime is liek a general label people use
OPEN	@Ryuse wanna take a look? u
QIQI	sure @Gerkek Commissions OPEN,anime, semi realism, I can experiment anyone of them
Ryuse	Eh
Ryuse	Get an artist role :3
Ryuse	I only tried semirealism once
Ryuse	I mostly do anime
OPEN	o, howd i go get the role? 😮
Pleinair	i mean most anime styles semirealistic
Ryuse	Send a mod a message
Pleinair	otherwise you wouldnt bother going for humanistic proportions
Ryuse	send them your work
Pleinair	for instance
QIQI	my interpretation of semi realism if the use of shade to make it look almost 3d
QIQI	but that is also truee
Pleinair	ghibili studios style uses less on the facial structure
Pleinair	and more on the bodylanguage
Pleinair	most of their characters arent intricately detailed
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	This is what I consider semi realism
Pleinair	until they want the character to have certain expressive traits
QIQI	for animation you cannot focus on details anyway, thats why some anime nowadays use 3D because their character have tooo many details. for example lovelive
Pleinair	then you have animes like bkub which are more designed to be memeish
Pleinair	and have a different focus
Pleinair	ofc anime and drawing are different but the concept applies
Pleinair	to both disiciplines
OPEN	aayyee, i got it
OPEN	ok, so what style would i fall under?
Pleinair	you got a very western design approach imo
Ryuse	I would say semi
OPEN	hmmm
Pleinair	more of a deviantart/tumblr artist kind
OPEN	ew w
OPEN	was never a fan of the tumblr style thing
Pleinair	hmm nothing wrong with those imo, theres many people who are willing to commission through there, from what i hear
QIQI	yeh youre style more focus on western with the very sharp outline and erm solid colors
Mochi	None
Mochi	yea its more of a western style
Yato	helo
OPEN	ye i do pretty much only use solid colors, pretty much no blending
Pleinair	but ya sorry if thats what you didnt wanna hear
OPEN	well idk what would be a deviantart style, and i dont see the tumblr. but then again i wouldnt know the characteristics of that either,
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	I think Plei just means western
OPEN	its the thicker lines and solid colors that makes it feel western right?
Ryuse	Its more of the head structure
Pleinair	I think its the rendering
Ryuse	Than the body
OPEN	rendering? o.o
Pleinair	The colors I guess
mart	huh
Ryuse	Really?
Ryuse	not the structure
Ryuse	None
Pleinair	I mean it could also be that too
Pleinair	Its not a simple you gotta change one thing
Pleinair	Type if deal
Ryuse	Cuz his rendering could also be applied to anime
OPEN	heres one thats a few months old
mart	thats really good
Ryuse	Thats more anime before
Pleinair	Id still say it looks western
OPEN	ty @mart and i think i use to do lines back then differently
OPEN	at one point i started to duplicate the line layer and blur it
OPEN	idk it made things pop?
Ryuse	Have u tried like
Ryuse	coloring your lines?
OPEN	actually, my lines are slightly colored
Ryuse	Slight eh
Ryuse	Alright
OPEN	i dont think ive ever used pure black, on lines or shadows
Ryuse	Nice
OPEN	lines are usually Purple , Red, or Blue. just verrryyy dark
Ryuse	I see
Ryuse	I usually change the color of the lines
Ryuse	according to the object
Pleinair	Hm
Pleinair	Could add some brighter tones too
OPEN	idk why my montergirls get purple, my cyborgs get blue, and my warriors get red
Ryuse	Well as long as it looks good I think all is well
Pleinair	Color coding perhaps?
OPEN	hmmm
narumi	ive no idea what style would you like to try but heres my lineart closeup just in case it helps
narumi	this was a year ago btw
Armannamra	narumi make gud art
Armannamra	None
QIQI	well then again western or anime, thin or thick, it is part of your style.
Ryuse	I like drawing cute stuff
Ryuse	So I try to make my pieces as adorable as possible
QIQI	@Gerkek Commissions OPEN your anatomy are pretty good though.
Ryuse	Anatomy or proportion?
QIQI	anatomy
Ryuse	I see
OPEN	ty 😄
Ryuse	@Gerkek Commissions OPEN oh right is there a reason why you joined this server for commissions?
OPEN	i just joined , id consider a comm, kinda full now atm
OPEN	hopefully not for long B
Ryuse	Hmm I see
OPEN	Neglecting my monstergirls ...
OPEN	None
Pleinair	wut kind of monstergirls u draw
OPEN	got a moth, a yeti, tall fish alien thingy
OPEN	and a Sadakoesque ghost whose a couch potato
OPEN	@Pleinair theres my moth, Ayla 😄
Ryuse	The only monster girl Ive drawn is probably just a dragon girl
Ryuse	Also a ram
OPEN	ooo, share? 0 u0
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	Ram
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	Then dragon girl
OPEN	ooo, watch 😄
Ryuse	Thank you XD
OPEN	aaand followed. lets get you to that 1k o
Pleinair	oo mothgirls
Pleinair	nice
Ryuse	It will be soon XD
Drakeanor	Im thinking about drawing Sakura fox form in future
Drakeanor	She is 420 y.o, so she will have 5 tails
Drakeanor	And Sakura is a friendly girl, so cant really give her fire ball like the fox in Naruto
Drakeanor	her main color is green so maybe power of healing?
Panty	i need some tips for line art, they always looks so flat and i cant properly weigh it like other artists. some advice would really help
Drakeanor	my line art sux so cant give advice
Drakeanor	if you go digital, maybe reduce the density
Drakeanor	for example, i use 3040 density for 710 size brush
Drakeanor	damn, I feel like idiot...
Panty	@Drakeanor what application do you use and ty
Drakeanor	Clip studio paint
OPEN	OOO, @Drakeanor , recently got that, i love it 😄
OPEN	you tried the vector line stuff?
QIQI	I use csp but I never use the vector, idk how to use it
AnDReeD	how hand do draw
AnDReeD	Yes
AnDReeD	What
Ryuse	@AnDReeD hand go fwoom bwoom
Ryuse	swish swish
Ryuse	fap fap
Ryuse	swiss wish
AnDReeD	Thank
Ryuse	Np
Mochi	@QIQI the vector layer is basically the same as raster layer but you can edit your lines
Mochi	You get these 4 extra tools
Mochi	Uuh I dont really know how to explain them so just try messing around with them
elixiink	I really want to post an artwork that Ive been working on hours for feedback TT but I need the dango role
BakaBot	you can dm a mod and ask if they give you the role they need a pic as evidence tho @elixiink
Flavie	Hi
Flavie	Also for the person struggling with lineart
Flavie	Maybe the setting of your pen I mean the actual pen your holding is bad
Flavie	You can go in brush environment settings and make it less or more sensitive
Flavie	At least it helped me
elixiink	@BakaBot Thanks for letting me know! Ill try contacting one of them
Chaga	None
elixiink	Thank you chaga!
OPEN	imo, the best feature of a vector layer is that resizing them doesnt cause them to go blurry, they stay sharp
CreamBootyAss	None
CreamBootyAss	i made this
Ryuse	Vectors as scalable
Ryuse	which is awesome
Flavie	I dont have the vector tool on my app
Flavie	Im sad it looks so cool
CreamBootyAss	have u listened to my song i made?
Flavie	Actually I really like the beat
Flavie	Would be so good with a good rap on top
Drakeanor	what is vector
QIQI	@Mochi ahh I see, so vector layer is better than normal one?or it useless, cause I never see any benefit of it, maybe im blind
Mochi	@QIQI I recommend using it if youre doing lineart
Mochi	You cant use layer mask on vector layers though
QIQI	@Mochi hooo 00 I see, Ill try it out
QIQI	hes the artist for disgaea and some other games, but mainly disgaea.
QIQI	@KOANGEL
Pleinair	basically his style is my guilty pleasure @ @
KOANGEL	OMG
KOANGEL	DUUDE i love that
KOANGEL	agghhh
Pleinair	ya he made a doujin for it
Pleinair	i bought it
QIQI	I bought his artbook too
KOANGEL	whats his artbook have inside? just his art or is it one of those tutorials things idk
QIQI	just art
QIQI	mostly his design
Pleinair	he does most of his art but he does also does his own stories
KOANGEL	cant buy it anyway but cool
KOANGEL	comics
KOANGEL	None
QIQI	tbh, his artstyle is pretty easy to learn if you look at some of his art
Pleinair	his designs and character tropes are very different from those we tend to see
Kyotaro	Ok you guys talking about artists?
KOANGEL	yes
Kyotaro	Whos your favorite artist
KOANGEL	no fav but i do see a group that i take in and try to see my own style fit through, i mostly see ppl through instagram
Pleinair	I posted mine
QIQI	too many
Pleinair	Kiki you like manga you should check out imitation crystals works
Pleinair	Youll love his style too
QIQI	ouhhh it is, pretty cute
Pleinair	Game club and spectral wish
Kyotaro	My favorite artists
Kyotaro	None
QIQI	@Pleinair if you like that kind of style, you might like terada tera
QIQI	she inspired me too, to make chibi ish character
Pleinair	oo ya her color tech is something i definitely would enjoy
KOANGEL	Okay actually I may have a fav
Pleinair	idk something about the usage of their shapes tend to draw me towards them
WooHan	Hello
QIQI	@WooHan heya
Pleinair	o/
KOANGEL	This person😩😭may be one of my favourites
WooHan	Omg, i love Sakusya
KOANGEL	Yesss
WooHan	I get inspired a lot by the artstyle
KOANGEL	They use thin lines and I tried but its pretty hard ngl
Kyotaro	If you wanna find more epic artists then you should use Pixiv
QIQI	not really thin its normal around 47 i guess
WooHan	Jup, my lines are not too thick but Ill trying to use thinner just to see how it looks
WooHan	Yup
Kyotaro	Pixiv has insane artists
Pleinair	hmm, pixivs the same as looking for artists on twitter
QIQI	true
Pleinair	just better for p0nz
QIQI	i prefer twitter,
Pleinair	cuz tweets dont like the p0nz
QIQI	you can find more overseas, pixiv focus on henhen and japan
WooHan	I follow them on twitter
Pleinair	though its easier to find funny meme granblue trends on twitter
Pleinair	None
KOANGEL	im new to twitter its hard to find many ppl..
KOANGEL	should i use hashtags to find em or search like
QIQI	follow one artist, then just check on recommendation
QIQI	thats how I do it tbh XD
KOANGEL	ohhh, ok ok
KOANGEL	no no that sounds easy and good
KOANGEL	thanks
QIQI	usually when you find one that you like twitter will recommend you artist that almost the same as what you like
KOANGEL	okay
WooHan	I also do what Kiki does
WooHan	None
Delcina	None
Delcina	Holy smokes..

Shizunne	oh no that now what i meant ahhaha...like...he features their work on his account. and people bid there on his account but the money goes to the artist he featured
Ryuse	Oh
Shizunne	or maybe a percentage goes to him idk
Shizunne	not really sure how but it was nice. he featured small artists too but had potential
Shizunne	so his audience saw the new artists as well
Shizunne	i think thats the concept of that 7 day event
Shizunne	oh my i just noticed u have 5k ///
Shizunne	i commend! derved as well
Ryuse	Hmm
Ryuse	I still dont get how their event work XD
Shizunne	None
Shizunne	what do u use when doing ur art btw if i may ask
Ryuse	SAI 2
Shizunne	and the device?
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	My tablet?
Ryuse	I just use Wacom Intuos
Shizunne	i dnt have a tablet
Shizunne	im trying to save though. but of course through my art but...pretty hard now
narumi	hang in there
narumi	if you need a cheap comfortable tablet i recommend huion h950p
Shizunne	yeah im trying. mouse give me cramps all the time ///
narumi	its around 50 bucks
narumi	dont worry im currently drawing with mouse too
narumi	my pen broke
Shizunne	yeah its hard right xD
narumi	I wouldnt say its hard
Shizunne	what app u use natrumisama
narumi	just time consuming
narumi	sai 2
Shizunne	yeahhh its very time consuminggg
narumi	this took more than hours as it usually only took me 30 minutes
Shizunne	kawaiii
Shizunne	yeah i feel you
Shizunne	the adopt i made took me 2 days including breaks though
Shizunne	which i think could have been finished for at the max, a day
Ryuse	I wish I can draw as fast as you guys
Ryuse	It takes me a long time to draw something
Ryuse	which is weird cuz back then I can draw faster
narumi	the more you draw the more youre obsessed with perfection
narumi	when you sketch and feel unsatisfied with something you get stuck there just to make it look good
narumi	my advice is to find out what part slows you down and find a way to overcome it
narumi	if youre slow on sketching, try very rough sketch first
narumi	if youre slow on coloring, save color paletes and make custom brushes
narumi	if youre slow with lines, fuck it play osu
Shizunne	My process was i started with still life drawings, realistic portraits and sketches in perspectives...i mean..those are our requirements in architecture
Shizunne	so it kinda practiced me to be faster i guess
narumi	you mean references?
Shizunne	yes
narumi	well yeah i still use references now and then
narumi	im sure even professionals do that
Shizunne	yeah
Shizunne	ethan becker even said
Shizunne	NEVER DRAW WITHOUT REFERENCES
Shizunne	and hes a profeesional artist xD
narumi	for me they help us sees thing outside of our imagination and see things differently
Shizunne	yep
Shizunne	very true
Shizunne	our professors even told us that too. its nice to draw from imagination but always use references
Shizunne	there are details we cant see much in imaginations alone
Shizunne	cuz usually imaginations are big and vague...something layk dat xD
narumi	thats what i just said yeah
Shizunne	have u tried painting or drawing on dispplay tabs?
narumi	I used to during my first day
narumi	but meh i dont like painting that much
Shizunne	i mean anime stuff too chibis...liek the usual that u do...have u tried them on display tablets?
Shizunne	like the ones u draw directly on screen
narumi	oh
narumi	my tablet is a display tablet though
Shizunne	OHHH
narumi	so should i say i do that all the time?
Shizunne	sorry ///
narumi	XD
Shizunne	gomene
Shizunne	None
narumi	its ok
Shizunne	i really wanna try it huhu
Shizunne	i think its waaay faster
narumi	not really
narumi	bigger screen makes you have to move your hands more
Shizunne	i mean compared to my mouse ///
narumi	well yes if youre comparing a pen with a mouse
Shizunne	what are u using again?
narumi	personally i prefer smaller graphic tablet for sketch then display tablet for details but its such a burden to switch them all the time
narumi	huion kamvas gt 191
Shizunne	damn...
Shizunne	the expensive one
Shizunne	my dream
Shizunne	None
narumi	well if you compare it with wacom..
narumi	its more reasonable and its worth the 400 bucks
Shizunne	so true...wacom is so expensive i just cant
narumi	wacom and huion is literally apple and android
Shizunne	OG TRUE
Shizunne	None
Shizunne	OMG
narumi	one for flex and one is quality
Shizunne	ur basically paying for the brand as well in wacom
Shizunne	its crazy
narumi	yeah
Shizunne	i prefer huion though
narumi	same
Shizunne	im saving for xp pen 13.3
Shizunne	just a small tab
narumi	xp pen is good too and cheaper than huion
Shizunne	but i guess its good enough for artist like me
Shizunne	yeah
narumi	but its kinda buggy since its not that big
narumi	but comparing that with the price id say its worth it
Shizunne	buggy in what way?
Shizunne	im curious
narumi	like driver error, shaky pen, tablet not found.exe etc
narumi	atleast thats what my friend has been ranting to me all the time
narumi	if anything id still pick huion
narumi	balanced quality and price
narumi	have no problem using it for 3 years kek
Shizunne	damn glad i heard that
Shizunne	now...im scared to buy 13.3
Shizunne	ahhahaha
narumi	well its just simple bugs that can be fixed with restarting your pc
Shizunne	does it occur often?
narumi	try looking on reviews before buying them
narumi	i dont have it so i dont know
narumi	but i dont think it happens often
narumi	otherwise no one would use it
Shizunne	what did ur friend buy?
Shizunne	was it 13.3 as well?
Shizunne	sorry for asking too many questions omg
narumi	idk what he has but i knows its xp pen
narumi	version doesnt matter tbh when it comes from the same brand
Shizunne	true true...
Shizunne	hmmm
narumi	well look
narumi	bad tools dont change an artists value
narumi	you have the tool, you be friend with that tool
narumi	I have the right to say that since i work with mouse rn but i dont like it whatsoever
Shizunne	true but im thinking fo the investment..im kinda scared to spend on something that might be faulty so im trying to search now the common problems of xp pens ///
narumi	why do you think they make it so cheap
narumi	its a reasonable price you pay for the pros and cons on the product
Shizunne	mmm ill keep that in mind
Shizunne	thnks for the info though
KOANGEL	first thing i saw was expensive vaccum ,nice
KOANGEL	id catch up but thats alota reading
Shizunne	None

Darling	Hey Im new to this server
Pleinair	o/
Darling	Does anyone have advice on working with a manga pen I just got a decent one and Im having a hard time with inking
Rambles	Hm, i used to own 1 too, watched a few tutorials and a scratch paper to practice inking different lines
QIQI	@Jochebed you can use reference and figure out from there. @Drakeanor and you dont need to buy a brush, theres alot of free assets you can get at the site. though I only use mapping brush lel.
narumi	@Darling i dont use one but you should practice strokes first
Panty	guys any tips on noses?
QIQI	realistic nose? or just anime
Ryuse	Noses are weird
Ryuse	Study the planes of the nose
narumi	dot
Panty	semi
Panty	like im trying to find a balance between abstract and realistic
Panty	i dotn want it to be just a line becus it looks hella wierd to me
QIQI	well you can just put a dot or a simple line, but then use shade/shadow to put more depth into it, thats the only way.
QIQI	again, you should gather reference and try copy, nothing wrong with copying and developing a style
Ryuse	@Panty what kind of semi do u wanna draw?
Panty	semirealistic but cartoon inspired
Ryuse	Example?
Ryuse	No I mean an art piece
Panty	an art piece
Panty	what u mean
Ryuse	A full version
Ryuse	Like a whole image
Panty	hmm lemme find one
Panty	like its detailed but simple at the same time
QIQI	yeh its all about shade, and depth of line
QiTong	@Panty OMG UR NAME YES

Drakeanor	None
Drakeanor	Neck and shoulder also have it charm
Drakeanor	None
Drakeanor	Also for drawing the collarbone, I think using color to emphasize it make characters look more thicc/muscular.
Pleinair	collar bone area is always important!
vinial	Thanks for the video its really helpful
Panty	ok its a little bit too early for studying skeletal structure. but doing muscles really will improve peoples art if they want a more realistic anime style
Mewtwo	Ok
Panty	if anyone wants any nsfw tips then just search prismblush and go to his tutorial section incognito is recommended
Mewtwo	Ok
Mewtwo	Why incognito tho?
QiTong	I love collar bones
QiTong	Its one of my fav part of the human body

KOANGEL	Discord servers have different chat room dedicated for its purpose, artwork is only art and this chat is artists talking yk yk
HirkaniBunny07	by continuing discord, I get a currency called EXP. So after a while after I get enough, a button will pop in the corner which will say upload pictures

KOANGEL	Yes

KOANGEL	This exp is needed to prove you are a artist
Nitrogen	fair
KOANGEL	Nooo lmao Ive been here a month, it can take a day
KOANGEL	Or two
KOANGEL	Or less
Empty0Smile	so like about one month?@HirkaniBunny07 Depends on how much you talk in this server
Pleinair	but you can aska a mod and show proof you do art or something
Empty0Smile	Tatsumaki bot is sleeping at moment
Empty0Smile	@HirkaniBunny07 How long have you been drawing

HirkaniBunny07	so i draw girls who are likw reaching the anime stage but not thereyet
HirkaniBunny07	XD
Empty0Smile	When did you start drawing art
HirkaniBunny07	well thats the thing
KOANGEL	Ouuu nice, I draw anime girls too, boys sometimes
HirkaniBunny07	i started in kindergarten
Nitrogen	can you draw a real face,, it will help develop your own style, while understanding others,,
Empty0Smile	There are a lot of different style
KOANGEL	I have no style ahhh
KOANGEL	It jumps
Empty0Smile	It does jumps around
Nitrogen	your style is just what you draw at that time,
Nitrogen	only those that sell their artwork have a set style, usually
KOANGEL	Perfect ex
Nitrogen	it looks pretty consistent to me
HirkaniBunny07	i started in kindergarten and then took a huge break until senventh grade. the beggining of seventh grade. nd im in seventh grade right now. And i tried drawing a realistic face once. It didnt look like anyone i knew but i guess it was ok. But it was sort of ugly
Empty0Smile	Nice art
KOANGEL	Oh I see
KOANGEL	Ty!
HirkaniBunny07	ohhh wow did you draw that? I LOVE the detail
HirkaniBunny07	where do i start?
KOANGEL	I do digital, watercolor, acrylic
KOANGEL	Also
HirkaniBunny07	i love the eyes the face well the everything
Empty0Smile	Its always good to start learning the basics first
HirkaniBunny07	wow i started digital yesterday
HirkaniBunny07	None
KOANGEL	I wanna see ur work dm meee! Bc you can post yet
HirkaniBunny07	yep ur right
HirkaniBunny07	whos dm ee?
Empty0Smile	@HirkaniBunny07 send me your artwork on the dm
KOANGEL	Yeah
Nitrogen	watching youtube on how to draw the face can help
HirkaniBunny07	whats dm?
KOANGEL	Here I will message you directly
HirkaniBunny07	ok ive been living under a rock
HirkaniBunny07	okie
KOANGEL	Direct message it means
HirkaniBunny07	ik what that means
Empty0Smile	Youll get it soon enough
Empty0Smile	it only takes time
KOANGEL	Ill gladly help I have nothing to do
Nitrogen	i started drawing in 7th grade too. i began by copying images i saw. it helps to steady your hand and improve hand eye coordination
crestfallen	Dm your artwork to an online onsen staff to get the artist role then youll be able to post in artwork
crestfallen	You could send it to me too as proof
Nitrogen	really, right now?
Empty0Smile	I started drawing like 6 month ago and I started drawing digitally in the last 2 weeks
KOANGEL	7th grade was my lil growth spurt in art , Ive been drawing as a baby, age 10 was anime, 4 years Ive been professionally trying now
KOANGEL	My digital first was so BAD LMAOO
HirkaniBunny07	ok so it says i got a new lwvel
Nitrogen	ive been trying to be serious with art since jan 1, 2019
HirkaniBunny07	level one
crestfallen	None
crestfallen	Nice
HirkaniBunny07	XD
Empty0Smile	Im 22 and the last time I draw when I was at school was in 4th Grade
Nitrogen	am 20,,
Empty0Smile	ive been trying to be serious with art since jan 1, 2019@Owen Liquid Nitrogen I know that feeling
HirkaniBunny07	LEVEL TWO YESS
Empty0Smile	Ohh Maki bot doesnt count
HirkaniBunny07	wut
HirkaniBunny07	wait so when i get to 500 i will get to send photos?
HirkaniBunny07	cause im on two rn
crestfallen	Yea
Nitrogen	since im that stereotypical shut in you see in anime, i dont have much else to do but drawing and writing
crestfallen	Wait no
HirkaniBunny07	oof i mean thats ok
crestfallen	@HirkaniBunny07 when you get 500 tatsu exp
crestfallen	You can check it at botcommands by typing trank
Empty0Smile	I does takes a lot of exp to get roles
Nitrogen	truly
Nitrogen	i dont care about any other channels than the 2 art ones,
Empty0Smile	The main issue that Im facing right with art is that Im not confident enough
Nitrogen	that was a real problem i used to have. the breakthrough that make me jump up in quality was to Never be afraid to draw ugly
Kami	Your confidence will grow with your skill
Nitrogen	and save everything you do, from sketches, doodles, whatever
Nitrogen	your skill will grow with your confidence, more like
HirkaniBunny07	I HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH MY ART
Empty0Smile	Im doing my best, but its hard to remove that feeling
Kami	Being indecisive with art in general due to lack of confidence is something worth growing through though
HirkaniBunny07	ya omg same
HirkaniBunny07	whenever i draw something ugly i usually erase the whole page XD
Kami	The way I got rid of it was drawing with pen without any planning with pencil
Nitrogen	Try doing studies of images where you try to recreate them using techniques you know. Not copying, but recreating. if you understand
Kami	Helped me learn to not fret over mistakes but adapt instead
KOANGEL	Oh I see kami, thats smart, dont erase but learn from it
Kami	Yeah
KOANGEL	Somthin I do is redraw one thing over and over
KOANGEL	Side to side, look at the changes I prefer
Empty0Smile	I used to delete drawing if I mess up a line, but I grew out of that when I didnt care about the quality anymore
Kami	Ill post a pic that I managed to make work even after mistake after mistake
Nitrogen	thats what you gotta do tho. Draw something. look at real thing. draw it again. do this infinetly
HirkaniBunny07	say owen can u send us some of ur art?
Nitrogen	people that practice 1000 poses once do them worse than someone that does one pose 1000 times
HirkaniBunny07	u sound like a proffesional artist
Nitrogen	I have been ramping up my learning this week. Been trying to put myself in that mindset
Nitrogen	I will post, once exp goes up,
Empty0Smile	You can learn something from professionals artist
HirkaniBunny07	ohh ok
HirkaniBunny07	ya so tru
Nitrogen	its about building a mental library of poses, and eventually you can draw from muscle memory alone
KOANGEL	Exactly
KOANGEL	Too much will kinda mess up the anatomy and that will become a part of the muscle memory
HirkaniBunny07	XD i suck at hands
Empty0Smile	youre not alone
KOANGEL	Look at one reference, basic shaping for a hand, and keep redrawing it!
HirkaniBunny07	ya i tried
KOANGEL	Like me neither but I do that
Empty0Smile	Just keep trying
HirkaniBunny07	so my fave pose is the hands behind back
KOANGEL	YES LMAO
KOANGEL	None
HirkaniBunny07	XD so true
HirkaniBunny07	i love that cat
HirkaniBunny07	XD rofl

Nitrogen	watch Sinix Design, he has a hand video. great things. I hope it is easy to understand for beginners
HirkaniBunny07	XD giant hips
HirkaniBunny07	when someone asks say she has a problem
HirkaniBunny07	None
HirkaniBunny07	i do that
Nitrogen	Sinix Design in general has a really good looking style and has tutorials on most body parts

HirkaniBunny07	i cant draw ccs
noa	Its tough, female anatomy gets easy
HirkaniBunny07	i suck at that
HirkaniBunny07	yepp
noa	ccs?
HirkaniBunny07	copy chracter
Mehh	I think this is mostly because men in anime and stuff are presented sort of muscular
noa	Whats a copy character? Just any character tht isnt urs?
Mehh	So you have to learn anatomy in more detial than for girls
noa	Muscles are super tough but fun to draw!
noa	Ive started to enjoy drawing them
Mehh	Like its harder to draw abs than bewpies
Mehh	Yeah Im studying up on anatomy, breaking stuff down to the very core
noa	This one is old but I still enjoy the muscles in this one
HirkaniBunny07	i suck at drawing... so i cant rlly relate
HirkaniBunny07	bro u draw that?
noa	yea, for a friends birthday
Mehh	OO
HirkaniBunny07	WHATTT
Mehh	Shiny

HirkaniBunny07	BRO MY CHRACTERS LOOK LIKE A BROKEN STICK FIGURE NEXT TO THAT
HirkaniBunny07	UR SUPER TALENTED, I HOP U KNOW THAT

HirkaniBunny07	omg u ARE 100 amzing whaddya mean?

noa	I enjoy the aesthetic
HirkaniBunny07	okie
HirkaniBunny07	i wish i knew how to draw animw
Panty	idk style trade i guess?
Mehh	Yeah Im mostly in that semi realism anime mix
HirkaniBunny07	im aiming to learn and know
noa	OHH style trades seem fun
noa	I wanna try that
Mehh	How do they work?
noa	Isnt it like trying to draw something in the same style as another artist?
Panty	u get a char then give it to the other person they draw
Panty	then show
Panty	i guess
noa	ohh
Panty	or like this char draw then present to each other
Mehh	Your own character or sth?
noa	Wouldnt tht be just an art trade?
Panty	anything really
Mehh	I dont get it x.x
Panty	i guess?
Panty	basically you get a subject.you both draw it
Panty	then u present to each other
Panty	i guess for fun?
Mehh	Oh
noa	Wouldnt tht just be an art prompt?
noa	I think I get what u mean tho
Mehh	👀 confusion intensifies
Mehh	Omg at most Ive done art trades smhhh
Mehh	Anyone here drawing environments? w
Mehh	Or tried drawing environments?
Panty	Xd i tried
noa	I want to try tht
Panty	too hard 4 me
noa	I def need to bc I cant do backgrounds
Mehh	Its pretty fun but I have no idea what Im doing
Mehh	I started cuz I had to make a comic for my midterm project 😂😂😂😂
noa	Ahh ok
Mehh	Spent 6 hrs on a single panel bg x.x
noa	I miss art classes
Mehh	Oh Meat how old are you? OO
noa	23
Mehh	Dayum
Panty	meat is meaty
Mehh	3 years older oo
Mehh	Aiigooo I cant post any art
noa	Oh ur not too young
noa	Surprising
Mehh	I know 😂😂😂
Mehh	I went though introductions and so many people were 1316 yrs old
noa	Yea, thus the life of discord
Panty	wait meat lesse your art?
Mehh	OHH MIDWAY TO 500 EXP I wanna spam sum art
Mehh	😂

noa	I can post more in artwork
Mehh	Meat do you do art for a living tho or on the side?
Mehh	Spam us with pretty boys
noa	Just on the side if I want extra money
Mehh	How can anyone say no to pretty boys
Mehh	Damn
noa	I usually dont do commissions often unless I rly need to
Mehh	Oh yeah I can see that
Mehh	Sometimes I get too lazy to draw
Panty	meat why u so sweaty
noa	WYM
noa	None
Panty	hmm language barrier i guess. it means you invested too many hours into drawing
noa	well I am 23
noa	Ive been drawing since I was a kid
Panty	im a kid
Panty	so therfore i shall become the good later
Mehh	The way Yana Toboso draws eyes
Mehh	Is bootyful
Mehh	Indeed
Mehh	Panty knows how art works
Mehh	pats
Panty	meh how old are you?
Mehh	Our poor art professor was trying to feed us years worth of art knowledge within 45 months
Mehh	Im 20
Panty	im currently 17 it will take me a few years to git gud
Mehh	We were drawing chairs for the whole semester
Mehh	To learn measuring 😂
Mehh	And observation
Panty	art skool/
Panty	None
Mehh	Then another 3 weeks of drawing still life tables
Mehh	Graphic design actually
Mehh	But same difference
Pleinair	hmm well graphic designs more about logo creating and dealing with vectors
Mehh	Well actually pure art schools are kuch tougher on you
Mehh	Yeah
Mehh	I just wanted to study animation... Aigo now I have photography to deal with...
Panty	well at least i still have my youth
Pleinair	None
Pleinair	i guess im the loser in this block o u o
Mehh	Why do you say that Pleinair?
Pleinair	28 o u o
Mehh	Panty if you wanna get good fast, study gesture and surface lvl anatomy
Mehh	Ohhh
Mehh	Why are you a loser tho?
Panty	thats what im doing OKAY?CCC
Panty	i sucky sucky
Mehh	If anything we might as well call you senpai 😂😂😂😂
Pleinair	it doesnt mean im good!
Mehh	Aiya
Mehh	You can always improve
Pleinair	ofc
Panty	where can i learn anatomy?
Mehh	Panty
Panty	apart from references online
Mehh	I can send you a book
Pleinair	hmm well take pictures of your body
Pleinair	and draw all over it
Mehh	None
Panty	nah dont have one
Pleinair	and notice certain patterns
Pleinair	things that you can use as shortcuts when drawing
Mehh	Is pdf format
Pleinair	or you can use as the base of when you draw something
Mehh	Best u can do though
Mehh	Is look up muscle structure
Panty	hmm what do i have to trade...
Mehh	Literal muscle structure
Mehh	Pretend youre a med student
Pleinair	e.g when drawing the hand, you can also start off where the thumb is
Mehh	And study the human body
Panty	will a cyberpunk 2020 book surfice?
Mehh	Where tendons connect
Pleinair	so you get a general idea of how to draw the rest of the hand
Panty	i can draw hands
Panty	but not body
Panty	i cant connect it
Mehh	Which muscle ends where
Panty	espically the torso and bottom
Mehh	Yeah
noa	Try doing anatomy studies
Mehh	That might be an observational problem
Pleinair	how can you not connect the body @ @
noa	Just sit down and just draw a bunch of bodies
Mehh	Observation is most important in art
Mehh	You need to know how to break down shapes to the simplest things
Panty	i mean i ca
Mehh	And you need to see through things
Panty	but the props arent correct
Panty	nah i aint using walls
noa	It takes loads of time to learn
Pleinair	hmm wait i drew with you panties!
noa	Even I dont do shapes
noa	I just eyeball everything
Mehh	Wdym?
Mehh	Surely you use gesture in your art?
noa	nah
Pleinair	hes transcend the need for shapes
noa	Only the head
Mehh	I cant imagine drawing human bodies from imagination without laying down basic line of action
Pleinair	and just goes with whats on his mind!
noa	Like this sketch I just did
noa	I just did the guidelines for the head only
Panty	such bad art 0/10 no big ass buldge
noa	Everything else is just sketch
Panty	it would be a 10/10 if he had a bigger buldge
noa	I made the bulge bigger but didnt wanna post anything too nsfw here
Mehh	Hmmm so critiques or praise?
Panty	bigger better
Mehh	Jeez Panty 😗😗
Pleinair	looks at jamil and lucio
Pleinair	i see
noa	Like I said tho this just a sketch, I usually do 2 sketches
noa	None
noa	Are u gbf fan
Mehh	His buttcheek is sticking out in a way
Mehh	Or is it just me oo
noa	Yea, from a certain angle with the leg you can see the bottom of the buttcheek
noa	If the ass is phat at least
Panty	when i see bulge i click
Mehh	None
Mehh	shrugs
Mehh	Do you guys use references often?
Pleinair	half and half
noa	None
Panty	i use for clothes and piose
noa	If I need one Ill get one
Panty	and other misc parts
Mehh	At which point do you think you have to credit the reference though?
Mehh	If you copy the pose?
Mehh	Or pose and clothing?
Mehh	Or that and shading as well?
Pleinair	i try to create my own shading/lighting
noa	I dont think references need to be credited unless its said they want it, but you shouldnt be copying the reference
noa	Copying and referencing are diff
Pleinair	for poses, if its something i never practiced or did
Pleinair	depends copying has its uses
noa	Yea for sure, but they are different for sure
Pleinair	i would say copying is more for learning
Panty	copying like tracing?
noa	you can copy without tracing too
Mehh	Tracing or just accurately drawing it
Mehh	With measurements
Mehh	How often do you trace? 😗
noa	Drawing everything as it is without changing much is copying
noa	I havent traced since elementary school
Panty	i dont trace. it breaks all kinds of unspoken laws
Pleinair	if im learning like an animal, i would trace shapes and break down those shapes
noa	yea
Mehh	Tracing is more common occurrence than you think
noa	Tracing helps to learn for sure but it shouldnt be smth tht u post if ur tracing someone elses work
Panty	i would only trace when learning
Mehh	Especially in the world of animation or YT entertainment
Panty	None
Pleinair	for humans, i guess i sometimes do that with styles
Pleinair	that i wanna try out or learn from
Mehh	I dont particularly mind tbh
Mehh	I have gotten lazy a few times
Mehh	Quickly traced the gesture of sth
Mehh	Then adjusted it according to what I need
Mehh	Like moving the leg or the hand or sth
noa	Yea that helps for sure
Mehh	I think that that only works with rl photos
HirkaniBunny07	huh
Mehh	Tracing other art makes it incredibly obvious
noa	Pleinair have u posted any of ur work here?
Pleinair	ya a bunch
noa	I also saw u mention gbf do u draw any
Mehh	Show us show us
Mehh	Or mee since I havent seen
Pleinair	i did BK
Panty	i dont post much bcus the art sucks and i mostly do skecthes
Pleinair	with orchid
noa	Aw!
Mehh	I wanna see everyones art
Mehh	Is it bad that Im roasty though? 3w3
noa	Panty its still good to post ur art!
noa	If u post in good environments its a good way to learn
Pleinair	None
noa	AW OMG
noa	orchid so smol
Pleinair	I WANT HER TO BE SMALL!
noa	Is it alright if I follow? I use Twitter most
Pleinair	suree i dont mind
Mehh	Damn good base in form and structure
Pleinair	been drawing them cuz i wanted to do a doujin about eugens death
Pleinair	🙏
Panty	BIG BOSS
Panty	THOSE ARE JUST KIDS
Panty	DONT HURT THEM
Nitrogen	I will tell you guys how to trace, and learn from it. by tracing an overlay of a pose or whatever you want to draw, you then use that overlay as your reference. boom
Mehh	Oh... The feet are a bit too small
Panty	its the style will beat any crit
noa	The feet looks fine for the style
Panty	Xddd
Pleinair	i thought about making the feet bigger
Pleinair	but it looks so weird
Mehh	Oya that only works if the silhouette of your pose is very clear no?
Pleinair	then again i can reduce the boot height
noa	Yea it would be off balance considering how you do proportions
noa	I think it looks cute n dainty
Nitrogen	even if they have baggy clothes, you should understand whats underneath,,,
noa	Yea for sure
noa	I always draw the whole naked body first then the clothes
noa	Like in my sketch
Mehh	Melons..
Mehh	cough I mean what
Panty	well yeah
noa	Tht looks so familiar
ShootingQuasar	Tifa ff7
Panty	its that girl from FF7
noa	I know, I meant the drawing itself not the character
Mehh	Perspective...
HirkaniBunny07	ooh noice
HirkaniBunny07	drawings
Pleinair	ya i seen quasar post it before
noa	oooh ok
noa	Thats prob where I seen it
ShootingQuasar	My hand is kinda shaky after carry plenty of stuff so ... I will do small detail later
ShootingQuasar	But that might be it for now

ShootingQuasar	@Mehh it take me 2 hour and half to finish
Mehh	Oof
ShootingQuasar	@noa if I have money to purchase the pad then I going to
ShootingQuasar	But for now nope
Mehh	Its a shame the picture has the weird lighting so not everything is perfectly visible
Mehh	Im so glad I got an XP Pen recently
noa	If u ever need a cheap on I recommend XP pen
Mehh	Is so nice
noa	O yea me too! I got mine free at AX
Mehh	AYOO man of culture right there
ShootingQuasar	Here @Mehh
Mehh	Needs a bit more contrast
noa	The lines have different weights so u cant see the top well is all
Mehh	Goodness Im so clooose to being able to post aaart
ShootingQuasar	Maybe cause of the light I can dm u the darker one
Mehh	But eh
noa	Its ok! Its just line weight
noa	I can see it
Mehh	I also draw using pretty light lines
Mehh	I have to edit photos of my art in lightroom quite often
Mehh	To fix the white balance, increase contrast, sharpen, dehaze, etc
noa	But yea XP pen is great n hopefully u could be as lucky as I was n get one free
ShootingQuasar	I just dm it

Panty	ewww
Panty	rich kid
noa	Im an adult with money
noa	Sorry ur still a baby
Panty	buying a doujin thats already free is like the ultimate flex
noa	you should tho if u like it, bc doujins are made by small artists trying to make a living w their art
Panty	or maybe its for when theres no wifi?
noa	Almost all online scanlations are art theft
noa	Bc they sell doujins for money
Panty	bruh they get plenty of comms
noa	Not all of them do that
noa	A lot of them dont
Panty	rip
noa	Doujins are their money source
noa	Havent u heard of comiket?
Panty	im in UK

Panty	then where is this?
noa	Its a japan only event where artists sell all their doujins
noa	Both SFW and NSFW ones
Panty	ohhh
noa	Its one of the biggest in japan
Panty	now at least 90 animes i watched makes 10x more sense
noa	But thats where ppl scan them from
Panty	i see i see
noa	I buy the doujins from ppl who go to comiket and shop for you
noa	So I tell them which stuff I want by certain artists there
noa	I just spent S150 on doujins just bc I rly adore the artists and never got to buy their work before
Panty	example artists?

Delcina	mhm
Panty	well yeah i know that but like it looks so perfect for them tho CCC

noa	low standards are the best to have imo
noa	Less stress, and ppl will love it anyways
Panty	yes but i must improve not make the same mistakes
noa	You can do tht while also keeping standards low
Panty	ill keep learning anatomy and shit like dat to git gud

ItsnotArthor	I have dmed someone, they havent replied, should i just wait?
SonnyynnoS	They should respond at some point, no worries
ItsnotArthor	Alright, thanks
noa	You can always talk abt art here to get ur xp up too!
Shark	yey
Delcina	yes
ItsnotArthor	I have a problem with drawing body proportions, what are some ways to practice?
Ryuse	Rip senpai didnt notice me
Ryuse	kek
Delcina	ono
rose	@ItsnotArthor tbh its just a lot of practicing drawing fullbodies, poses and such
rose	At least for me
Delcina	u can do simple gestural drawings ouob @ItsnotArthor
Delcina	and anatomy studies
ItsnotArthor	How about being able to do postures and proportions before then stopped
ItsnotArthor	Can I get that back? I fear I might gain a new one I dont like
Delcina	well, theres no reason to fear to be honest
Delcina	its all up to your motivation to draw and not procrastinate
Delcina	and your knowledge about postures and gestures should retain as stock knowledge, the only way you unlearn something is either you forgot about it or you get an amnesia
ItsnotArthor	Or havent draw for 3 years i guess?
ItsnotArthor	Thats gonna take awhile
Delcina	ono
Delcina	actually, I stopped drawing for a year after an incident and it had a little bit of getting used to again
Delcina	practice and hard work always pays off in the end
Delcina	so, all you have to do is just practice
narumi	@ItsnotArthor There are no such tips that will help you directly with your skills.The key is to nonstop practice and experiment, dont be afraid to fail!
ItsnotArthor	Thanks, I will see to it I do so
ItsnotArthor	And thanks for the role, uh, Kyaru
narumi	Yeeah call me with the waifu name
ItsnotArthor	So uh this is what i needed help and feedback with
ItsnotArthor	Its not done, i need help with hues, lights, and shades
ItsnotArthor	This is my first project with a mediumheavy amount of detail
narumi	I think it looks great!
narumi	I see youre into colder hues
narumi	Try browsing DeviantArt for some realistic paintinf references!
narumi	they mostly use cold colors
ItsnotArthor	Thanks, Ill check deviantart out
ItsnotArthor	Man, its been like 6 years since Ive opened up DA
narumi	I never did but just from the name I feel like majority people draw realistic there
Ryuse	@narumi go into it :3
Ryuse	Just remember to keep something holy with u when going there
narumi	Pixiv is my religion
narumi	Ah shit I forgot I cant use that word
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	I just use Twitter
narumi	Uhm, DA has furry 18
Ryuse	DA is cursed
Ryuse	But its where most of my followers are
narumi	your followers are cursed
narumi	None
Ryuse	Oh probably
narumi	well DA is probably where most people have their adoptables sold
Ryuse	I finished drawing Salla chan
Ryuse	Mhmm
Ryuse	DA is big on that
narumi	big gae
ItsnotArthor	Whats wrong with Pixiv?
Ryuse	Hopefully Salla notices my work
Ryuse	@ItsnotArthor nothing
Ryuse	Its DA thats cursed
ItsnotArthor	DA was really good back then, I remember
Ryuse	Its still alright
ItsnotArthor	Wait isnt 18 content closed to anon visitors?
Ryuse	I guess?
Ryuse	I turned on safe mode on DA and Im still not safe
Ryuse	I had to install a filter
Ryuse	That lets me block cursed works
Ryuse	Now 70 of the site is blocked D
ItsnotArthor	Whats it called?
ItsnotArthor	The filter
Ryuse	Deviantart filter
Ryuse	Its just a script
ItsnotArthor	Oh I guess theres some tutorial online I can look up
ItsnotArthor	Is there
Ryuse	Maybe
ItsnotArthor	I saw Tifa
Ryuse	Well you can just Google and find out how
ShootingQuasar	@ItsnotArthor that was quick
Ryuse	Ill get back to video editing

Pleinair	well you can trace first to get a feel
DevZest	i have some drawing that i was able to do that looked pretty good but could never seem to be able to get used to it even drawing the faces and everything
Pleinair	and do some breakdowns
Pleinair	and analyze
DevZest	well ive done like copying looking at my favorite art and trying to replicate it not tracing
noa	It takes years of doing that to be honest
DevZest	but could never get the hang of it
Pleinair	i say trace because you get a feel for the lines and your not fighting fighting between your vision
noa	Id say take a bit from tutorials as well
noa	Try doing studies of just bodies
Pleinair	and the art pieces
noa	None
Pleinair	your just getting a understanding of how this piece works
DevZest	ive searched for a long time for videos but its hard to understand sometimes
noa	it is! Just practice bit by bit
DevZest	like i can draw something by looking at an already done art work but it just takes time and alot of erasing
ayakaisno	yeah! Bodys are hard, and the yt videos can be confusing but I say if you just keep trying u can do it ya know
noa	None
noa	Its just a matter of keeping at it, remembering how the lines move when u copy, then try to incorporate that into ur own work
DevZest	would it be fine if i showed you guys an oc that ive done but could never replicate
noa	Sure!
ayakaisno	YEAHH
Pleinair	gofor it
DevZest	in artwork right?
Pleinair	well you might need the artist role
noa	ok Im stumped on this drawing of my oc
ayakaisno	Awe why
DevZest	cant seem to find the artist role
noa	I like how some artists put like nonsensical text on their art
noa	You need to get the role from narucchi
noa	Either ping or dm him
noa	But like I like the text thing, but what phrases even make sense man
noa	I wanna put text on my art but what words
DevZest	@narumi may I have the Artist role?
ayakaisno	Mabye something that goes with the art
ayakaisno	I wana get the art role to but Im to lazy to dm rn anwb
DevZest	None
ayakaisno	aAa
ayakaisno	Iv been drawing a lot of my tv ocs lately
ayakaisno	Idk w h y but ye ah
DevZest	its so hard to draw from the top of my head
ayakaisno	Awe
ayakaisno	Try it one day! Mabye youll get the hang of it!
DevZest	Ive tried so many times
noa	how long you been drawing for?
DevZest	hmmm
DevZest	i think i started in the middle of last year and then stopped like 3 months ago idk why
noa	Yea, u def need to try more then for sure
DevZest	so im trying to pick it back up again
noa	Drawing just takes nothing but time and consistency
ayakaisno	I mean thats cool that your picking it back up again!
noa	Youre not gonna be perfect at it in just a year, dont get discouraged!
noa	Im still not perfect at it for sure
ayakaisno	Yeah it takes a heck of a lot of t I m e
DevZest	ya i know its just like you always wanna see that improvement but its hard to grasp
noa	It is, its rly hard to not get discouraged when it doesnt turn out as planned right away
noa	But just loads of visual studying
noa	Observe how stuff is drawn in art you like
DevZest	Especially drawing hair aaah
Titan	relatable
ayakaisno	But hands down
ayakaisno	doe
ayakaisno	Now hands are h a r d
DevZest	None
noa	Ive actually practiced hands so much tht I enjoy drawing them
Titan	I always feel like hair is the break or make
DevZest	exactly
Titan	Hands are hard at some angles
ayakaisno	I drawl hair a lot so its kinda easy for me
DevZest	for hair it wont look right unless you have like the right thickness
DevZest	and length
DevZest	which makes it even more challenging
ayakaisno	Oo
Titan	Hair weird
Titan	especially anime hair
Titan	it goes like 🔼🔼🔽🔄
DevZest	XD
Titan	And there are those characters with really complicated hair
DevZest	im drawing hair for a character rn and i cannot get past the bangs
Titan	it be like that
ayakaisno	Floofy hair is really easy for me to drawl so like all my oc have f l OO fg hair

tooki	Hello you guys!Mightve forgotten me by now, but my name is Karine or Tooki or Kotton on AF, and last year, I organized a huge art telephone game. Now, because of quarantine and sheer boredom, I am going to try and make ANOTHER ONE! This time, Itll be bigger and even more organized.What is art Telephone?Art Telephone is a nice minigame in which a player receives a character and has to draw them in their style. As smaller tweaks turn into personality traits and the difference in skills and styles completely reshape the figure, the finished product will be totally different and will show the awesome development through the drawings. What am I looking for?First of all, more staff members! I am looking to turn this into an actual event, and for that reason, I will need people to help me collect the drawings, organize them by numbers and sign new members.Also, obviously, artists like you guys the way your styles differ would look awesome in the project and Id love if anyone wanted to join nThe Project itself would start by 1.5 Till then, you can still sign up and end by MAXIMUM 1.7. This because artists require a certain amount of time to finish their work! If it takes TOO long, we will pass over to the next artist so manage your time correctly. I am planning on having 4050 members, depending on the complexity of their art and their ability to finish it quickly, so we can reach the best outcomes in the easiest way. Please DM me to apply and become one of those!For now, staff is more necessary so we can organize the project
narumi	Art tele is fun, go join if you have free times
PinkC4ndy	how to join art tele?
narumi	contact that guy
narumi	tooki
Delcina	does anyone want their OC to be commissioned?

Ryuse	Like u need to let others know the relevant information and expectation
Ryuse	But yeah
Ryuse	The prices looks alright
Delcina	ouob
noa	What abt their examples?
Ryuse	I looked through their insta
Ryuse	I wont say anything tho :3
noa	OH didnt see the username
Delcina	lmao
Delcina	theyre starting out and I dont want to hurt their feelings if I priced her art low
Ryuse	Theyll still get hurt tho :3
Ryuse	The first commission is the hardest to get
Delcina	true
Delcina	going around and asking for commissions is the way to go to sell yourself actually
🎀	I have to do commissions today but I dont want to move from my bed

KOANGEL	Or a full body colored for S35
KOANGEL	None
noa	Why not?
noa	Ive seen some artists charge full bodies for S350
noa	The way Ive seen it is just dont undercharge urself
noa	If smth takes u hours give urself a good hourly pay just like a real job
HirkaniBunny07	yess u should do that ko, ur art is awesome
KOANGEL	But I feel like not enough people know me, on Instagram or Twitter, anywhere
noa	Not enough ppl know me either
noa	Just dont under sell ur work!
noa	Looking at the commissions server makes me so sad bc everyone undercharges like S5S30
noa	so I always pay a lot more
HirkaniBunny07	it doesnt matter how many people know u. It just matters what u do! If you do a good job, you deserve a lot
KOANGEL	None
KOANGEL	Okay I will work on what you guys think I deserve thank you💗

crestfallen	No wtf
Kazooie	Woah thats great!
crestfallen	Those are good
Red.	Yeah i know
BIRAKTI	you guys are just doing so i would not be feeling bad
BIRAKTI	these are bad
Milk	I dont wanna say anything, but I reverse Google searched @BIRAKTI
Kazooie	Im serious. These are great!
Kazooie	Really, really great!
BIRAKTI	@Milk do you really think like that im having art lessons in my school
BIRAKTI	If you want you can think like that but thats your choice
Milk	I mean.. Google says that.. you snatched it
Kazooie	Its great art!
Milk	Kuro..
Milk	Check dms..
Kazooie	Ok... Its stolen. Its not great to steal!
narumi	that escalated quickly
Milk	Nah
narumi	i mean you can already tell its stolen from the quality gap
Milk	Yea
Kazooie	Is the second one legit?
Milk	No
BIRAKTI	i would show you the proof wait

Milk	Ygz dont even try

Delcina	do you perhaps know Potaco in Twitter?
Delcina	None
Nitrogen	Well, copying is a part of training process
Nitrogen	So theres nothing to be ashamed of
Nitrogen	Its the first stage any artist achieves
narumi	yeah but posting it and claiming its yours is just wrong
Nitrogen	That is correct
Nitrogen	I used to try to draw attack on titan frames as practice long time ago
Nitrogen	But I am way past copying phase now in my current level, I feel at least
narumi	I still trace now and then for different prespective
Delcina	sad art thief moments
narumi	but posting them would destroy my career
Nitrogen	Yes Ofcourse I trace over references when I practice so I can understand the guidelines. Its really good to do that
Delcina	I trace over the pictures I take irl
Delcina	does that count as no practice?
Delcina	only of backgrounds, but not people of course
Nitrogen	Well in many manga they just put a filter on pics as background
Delcina	sad art thief momentsLMAO
narumi	well everytime you draw and you improve, thats technically practice
Delcina	None
narumi	everytime you draw, you practice
Delcina	i use things as reference or copy it but i dont trace
narumi	makes sense yeah?
narumi	references are good
Delcina	I guess I do learn a bit everytime I draw
narumi	drawing from your own imagination will cause your work to look blend trust me
Delcina	if you use a million references you can get a whole anime boy
Delcina	lmao
Delcina	but Ive never traced anything after I got into Highshool
Nitrogen	If theres a pose you want, learn it part by part
Delcina	blend?
narumi	I was taught to trace since primary
Delcina	drawing from your own imagination will cause your work to look blend trust mei can only draw fork my imagination once in a while if im motivated enough
narumi	ah not blend
Delcina	were you trying to say bland?
narumi	bland
narumi	yes
Delcina	yes
Delcina	lmao i said fork instead of from
Kazooie	I always tried to draw something good but I always fail lmao
Delcina	I always tried to draw something good but I always fail lmaosame
narumi	endless practice
narumi	we all have been in that stage

Kazooie	Pwease!
Milk	Bears art is Chad
Delcina	lmao
Delcina	my artwork is as the request
narumi	i couldnt keep up because my friends were getting better and better while i was at the same stage@Boswell youre stressing over on how to get better than others, therefore you will never enjoy drawing and satisfy yourself with your own works
Delcina	mhm
Delcina	@Lawrenson youre stressing over on how to get better than others, therefore you will never enjoy drawing and satisfy yourself with your own worksyeah its true
narumi	draw for fun, not compete
Delcina	but i cant draw without references
narumi	but on competition? take them out
Delcina	yes
Delcina	and when i have a reference i always compete with it
BIRAKTI	Bro There are millions of that art and i draw the same character

HirkaniBunny07	whats calc?
Pleinair	pretty sure schools nowadays are much more lenient
Pleinair	calculus?
HirkaniBunny07	no this is an extra curricular
Pleinair	i guess in a way its easier than algebra
HirkaniBunny07	i go to a specy class to learn this worthless junk that i will learn answays in two years
HirkaniBunny07	nooo geo is like critical thinking
HirkaniBunny07	i dont like it
Pleinair	and pretty sure many popular games use equations applying calc
HirkaniBunny07	no no to math
Pleinair	well for dmg formulas
HirkaniBunny07	calc...
HirkaniBunny07	wat?
HirkaniBunny07	dmg?
Pleinair	damage?
Tensai	yooo

HirkaniBunny07	ohh ok
HirkaniBunny07	but do u like math and all?
HirkaniBunny07	u sound rlly smart
Pleinair	smart , thats a terrible blanket word, but I used to like math

Mira68	Anyone have any tips for character building? Back story and stuff like that
HirkaniBunny07	yepp just let ur mind wander and u will get ther
narumi	hmm you should first know what kind of story youre into. Decide the characters fate and let yourself be the character
narumi	its more of a story writters work but you can get the job done
HirkaniBunny07	yess
HirkaniBunny07	i agree
Pleinair	character building hm?
Pleinair	for me I guess, i tend to think of a scenario and just go you know this kind of character would really be interesting to have in this kind of setting
Pleinair	and depending on their skills and abilities, id make sure is explainable in their backstory
HirkaniBunny07	yee
Pleinair	for character fate, i dont think you need to think too far into the future unless you plan to write a whole story about them
Pleinair	id prolly go as far as creating relationships, their journey/mission/career/daily life
Pleinair	and whats their interest/desires
HirkaniBunny07	yeah
Mira68	So Im doing this project with a few people its on an alien planet and mammals got there so Im trying to develop character for that they said before I become an actual part of the team I need to work on my character build abilities then I can get a spot probably in the later future once they open applications once again since I got laid off
Mira68	So Im just trying to learn how to make someones backstory sad but not cliche or happy but not a Merry Sue angry but not the stereo typical angry character if you know what I
Mira68	Mean
Pleinair	hmm what are the limits to this world? are these just normal humans?
Pleinair	but its a dangerous world
HirkaniBunny07	nice idea
HirkaniBunny07	it has potential
Razr	Think about what this characters motives are, their abilities, how would they get there and why? What makes them a character and pour some of yourself into it. It could be unique type of sad instead of the norm of loss of life too
Pleinair	what age do you wanna make this character? how long did this character live on the planet
HirkaniBunny07	yeah
Pleinair	but ya you got many routes you can take
Mira68	Its not my idea but I had two characters also the the mammals have been here for a few years and have somewhat evolved subtlety, The animation/show is meant to like take place on a world called RMX the creator of this btw is zirlwynbandits on YouTube forgot to credit
Mira68	The mammals are anthropomorphic and the aliens are meant to be completely different to show diversity
Mira68	And the one in depth character development throughout the show
Mira68	Theres a cult/group called the Bandence which is hard to explain
Mira68	Bandits
Mira68	The leader is zirlwyn a black wolf
Mira68	And I was trying to make a tiger and a lioness oc
Mira68	None
Mira68	This is what I had written
Pleinair	how much do you read?
Pleinair	like overall estimate
Pleinair	or even consume content like movies
Mira68	I dont read to much I have a hard time focusing, I watch tv shows and movies all the tine
Mira68	Time
Pleinair	from your TV shows
Pleinair	what ideas, traits and motives do you think make a good character?
Pleinair	or one that compels people to like
Mira68	I always tend to like the characters I relate to more and I think that is a little bit of narcissism but you know, so I tend to be compelled by characters who are more aggressive in the sense of those snap easier but by the end of the show or movie theyll change and be more mature,
Mira68	Octavia from the 100 if you know that
Mira68	And I really hate the underdog type story that every movie almost fall
Mira68	Follows
Pleinair	alright so, lets make your character more into something you like
Pleinair	since itll be easier to do so, since you have a clear idea in what you favor
narumi	i think its better for you to ask this on storywriter
Pleinair	i mean i think its fine in both, since most people do OCs that get them into art
Pleinair	then again it does need more people talking there...
Mira68	Sure lets move
KOANGEL	@Mira68 I saw the whole convo and yes! I love the 100 and octavia I see where youre trying to go with this
Mira68	Yeee
Mira68	Shes my favourite
KOANGEL	John Murphy and octavia are my favorites hell yeah
KOANGEL	But octavia pisses me off sometimes ngl😣idk if youre caught up
Mira68	Yep completely watched it 3 times
Mira68	If she actually is dead Im gonna be pissed
Mira68	I dont like Clark at all shes a narcissist
Mira68	Octavia has reason for why she was so different
Mira68	Clark is just a narcissist my opinion
noa	I have no idea how to come up w names
noa	I have multiple OCs but all of them are nameless
KOANGEL	Huh ur kinda right, and tbh I dont pay much attention to her even tho shes the main character
KOANGEL	Oh meat!
KOANGEL	Search up names with meanings that go with your oc
noa	Thats the thing I need meanings first
noa	and Im super picky
noa	They just end up being unnames
noa	named
KOANGEL	One of my OC, Like her name is aratani which means precious stone aka her diamond sword
KOANGEL	Ah the meanings well is the personality hard to think of? Base them off moods
Pleinair	i think its fine for nameless MCs
KOANGEL	Maybe
KOANGEL	That could help
noa	Mine arent rly for stories n such
Pleinair	cuz sometimes the name doesnt need to have any symbolism, and can just be any random name
noa	Just for art n doodles
KOANGEL	Thats also true
KOANGEL	I dont have a sorry either I just like givin a personal lil bio, age, name, all that Jazz
Pleinair	bios are fine
Pleinair	just name and age can be changed any time
noa	At this point my OCs mean nothing they are just ppl I can commission other ppl to draw
noa	Ive been pooping out empty characters
noa	None
Pleinair	None
Pleinair	i wanna do storyboards and what not, but i lack the experience and wanted to have someone join me on the journey
noa	I always dreamed of doing tht when I was younger
noa	But I only have the brains for visual stuff
noa	I cannot do any thing good with writing to make a comic or anything
KOANGEL	Ouu, I stopped writing but I always had full plots in my head, my hand refuses to write a lot
KOANGEL	but then it likes to draw a lot wtf
KOANGEL	None
noa	Id have ideas for stories, but could never draw them out bc I cant fill in anything in between scenes, plot holes etc
KOANGEL	I feel like watching a lot of movies or reading books helps create ideas
KOANGEL	Mix em up
noa	Oh no like I said I get ideas, but I have no writing skills to bring them together
KOANGEL	I love dystopian genres, in which I did make a story on but never finished, the plots all there tho😔it was so good
KOANGEL	Ohh ohh okay
KOANGEL	Well in that case same
KOANGEL	None
noa	tfw artist but not a writer
noa	None
Pleinair	just opem a google doc and just type wutevers in your head, then start drawing!
Pleinair	its wut i do
Pleinair	when i get an idea
KOANGEL	type? Whats that I use voice type
KOANGEL	None
Pleinair	None

KOANGEL	Like imagine yourself in that situation, you might see if it crossed the line
Arugula	Like you do hate art

GloriaTheAnimator	i think you need highlights
GloriaTheAnimator	try taking a ligh blue and going all the white
GloriaTheAnimator	or light yellow
GloriaTheAnimator	pastel colors are good for highlights
elixiink	If you open the picture in a browser youll notice the actual colour of the hair is a wine red kinda like that and Ive been having a hard time finding a suitable highlight for wine. I tried reds/oranges/yellows but they look terrible XD I tried playing around with the colour wheel because I wanted a different hue for the highlight but I got nothing
GloriaTheAnimator	leme try overpainting it cuz i got nothing better to do
elixiink	Sure! Thatd be helpful tbh XD
GloriaTheAnimator	None
GloriaTheAnimator	yes i was right
GloriaTheAnimator	blue high lits fit

HirkaniBunny07	whats that...?
sushi	krita has an animation version built in
sushi	i didnt know if anyone knew how to work it
HirkaniBunny07	its a mystery to all
sushi	specifically, im trying to make a zoom in shot but the second frame is always overlayed over the first frame
sushi	very puzzling
HirkaniBunny07	yepp i wish i could help but i suck at tech stuff
sushi	nah its okay i figured it out
HirkaniBunny07	ooh okie good!
Mira68	these outfits are fire, i dont know the artist who made them

HirkaniBunny07	ohh ok
BETO50	@Mehh your draws are so good
Mehh	Thank you oo
Delcina	hey there.
KOANGEL	hiya juzou
Tensai	o
Nitrogen	@Mehh could it be the placement of the ear that makes the drawing look weird?
Tensai	o
Mehh	Omg
Mehh	I was thinking that yes
Mehh	I was originally using the ear to indicate the head was turned upwards
Mehh	it looks weird
Mehh	now
noa	Ear prob does need to be a lil bigger, But I think the perspective of the head/face is a lil off
noa	Its not completely noticeable but its the first thing I thought when I saw it
noa	But I love your coloring style and the perspective on the body, it looks great
Mehh	I worked so much on the body
Mehh	I neglected the face
Mehh	Even tho its a portrait
Mehh	gg me
noa	its ok I do tht a lot
noa	Ive noticed I neglect the face a lot when I do full bodies, and neglect the body in portraits
Mehh	Ive just been drawing so many figures usually for gesture no face full body and some realism and doing some mechanical drawing
Mehh	That I legit forgot
Mehh	How to properly draw a face
Mehh	let alone an anime face
Mehh	internal screaming intensifies
Pleinair	yawwwn

Smugi	yo do you guys think this could look official? Just finished it tonight
KOANGEL	Idk why but a little shaded part could make it better Im the background, like diagonally my brain keeps sayin
KOANGEL	If u dont get it its fine! It looks amazing
Delcina	pretty nice.
Pleinair	official?
Pleinair	if it could replace the coverart for a boruto manga?
Pleinair	no.
Pleinair	only because your using a different rendering style imo
Pleinair	but if it was for like your own manga, it would look pretty decent
narumi	he asked if it looks like official
narumi	well I guess if were talking about boruto you should change the background to orangeish
narumi	Looks great for a cover but it looks empty
Smugi	I see, idk it was my first step into cover work cause I usually just paint portraits and this was for the 6 fan art shit ppl have been telling me to do
Smugi	My usual stuff
Xano	Its cool
Delcina	cool painting owoo
noa	Love the body horror theme, one of my favs for sure
Razr	Yesss I love me mah horror and body horror

Diamondship	I just started drawing a few days ago and drawing anime faces is my current nightmare
Diamondship	Anybody pls help me
noa	It rly depends on what you like imo
noa	Anime is a rly broad style, there are an endless amount of ways you can draw anime faces
noa	Id say find art you like the most and try imitating and studying the way the faces are drawn in those
Nitrogen	learn realistic first before understanding anime, honestly
Nitrogen	without understanding the face, you wont know where to put things
HirkaniBunny07	yee u should random stuff that u like and u will finally find out what u like
Mehh	sneaks in
Mehh	Anyone here have a Wattpad sketchbook?
Diamondship	I use printer papaer
Diamondship	Paper
Mehh	Omg xD
None	Same here @Diamondship
Diamondship	Do you suffer paper getting lost all the time
Smugi	@Diamondship I recommend studying the asaro head, and learning how to render a real face before trying to stylize anything.
Diamondship	Asaro?
Smugi	if youre struggling to draw an anime face then it all comes back to learning to draw in general. Your fundamentals of Form, Shape, Edges, Values should be learned
Smugi	None
Smugi	bam
Smugi	The Asaro Head is a very popular tool to learn planes of the face
Smugi	and once youve studied planes of the face, do some studies from pinterest or from people.
Smugi	I got a whole pinterest board of portraits I like to use when I do studies
Smugi	None
PinkC4ndy	Guys, I need help with my drawing.
PinkC4ndy	how to add shine in her clothes?
Panty	what is her clothes made of
Panty	@PinkC4ndy
PinkC4ndy	like latex
narumi	set layer mode to luminosity
Panty	use latex reference on google and try and match lighting and go over with a coloured brush in a new layer
PinkC4ndy	ehhmm...guys, im not using clip studio paint or any drawing application, im using inkscape
narumi	well ita gonna be hard
narumi	just cell shade it with lighter color and use softer brush to add blend effects
noa	If your style is just cell shading just cell shade
noa	Choose a color thats like a warm grey, closer to red, bc latex reflects color and light
Najimo	Hey
Sevirous	heyya qt
Najimo	Whats up
noa	Experiencing art block
Panty	wow me too

ZeroX	None
Ryuse	Hai
Ryuse	Whats happening here
ZeroX	Idk
Tensai	uhh
Sevirous	We should motivate each other
Sevirous	Lez do quick sketches
Smugi	@PinkC4ndy its dependent on your value. If you want shine then establish your direct light and then paint in some ambient lighting and include your occlusion. Also remember light and shadows form shapes
Smugi	Values
Smugi	But just shift up in your light family if you want shine. Dont airbrush it all bc itll look pillow and ugly
ZeroX	Lel
noa	I been sketching all night but to no avail
noa	I dont like how any of it looks
Panty	maybe if you change your perspective

Delcina	owo
Delcina	Ill be borrowing a quote from Ratatouille but revised.
Delcina	Anyone can draw
narumi	everyone here cant draw
narumi	not until we Start
Delcina	it takes time to practice and find your own artstyle especially when youre just starting out, but as you continue, youll see that youre starting to develop your own. Everyone has their own pace at drawing as well so you dont have to worry about having a starting point at drawing because youre only at the journey of it, there is no end because humans have the potential to do anything uwu
Delcina	@narumi listen to Start Dash from Lovelive xD

Hensan	Is anyone here got open commissions
Hensan	I got a friend who has a request
Panty	@Hensan ill do it for free as long as credit
Panty	becus my art sux
Hensan	Well he needs it for something important
Panty	what is it
Panty	album art?
Panty	twitch?
Panty	i have a portfolio
Panty	@Hensan i need info
Pleinair	wipes sweat
Pleinair	do you really want a request?
Hensan	Dunno what the details are but he asked me for Instagram pages or Twitters
Panty	tell him what is it for ffs these people
Hensan	Converting models photo shoots into cartoon/anime digital versions
Hensan	Is what he said
Panty	jesus god no. try fivver or twitter. not discord servers
Hensan	I literally asked if anyone had a Twitter or a Instagram
Hensan	For an open commission of something professional
Pleinair	hm
Pleinair	he can do that in unreal engine
Panty	something important doesnt always mean pro lmao
Pleinair	and then change the grain
Pleinair	so it becomes black and white like a manga
Hensan	Im pretty sure hes asking for a redraw with the model as reference
Hensan	Using it for advertising or something
Pleinair	similar to how punpun artist does it
Hensan	Oh punpun is great
Pleinair	None
Pleinair	like this
Panty	nice
Panty	would actually do this if i can afford assets
Panty	but blender is better for this in my opinion
Pleinair	hmm, iirc blenders lighting isnt as realistic as unreal4s
Panty	wdym
Panty	None
Panty	the same if not better
Panty	what matters is just good lighting and assets
Panty	and you can make anything look good
Pleinair	thats not the same as using unreal
Pleinair	what hes doing is different
Panty	idk man
Panty	None
Pleinair	what about bigger scale?
Pleinair	and how longs the rendering times?
Pleinair	but either way, things have changed alot then
Pleinair	guess both ways are worth learning
narumi	@Hensan so theyre ok with anime?
Hensan	Yep
Hensan	Thats also probably why he asked me
Hensan	None
narumi	I can do it
Hensan	Is discord the only way he can contact ya?
Hensan	None
narumi	he can contact my instagram or twitter aswell
narumi	narucchii
Hensan	Alright ill let him know
Hensan	Thanks naru
Hensan	None
narumi	None
Sevirous	None
Delcina	experimenting with a new artstyle owo
Sevirous	noiceee
Ryuse	@Panty Oh blender eh
Ryuse	I used it before
Ryuse	Heres a donut render I did by following a tutorial
M.K.	rlly tasty
M.K.	my brother did the same tutorial lul
Ryuse	None
Ryuse	I dubbed this as cursed donut
Ryuse	I tried implementing 3D model to my illustrations
Panty	that sounds like a terrible idea
Ryuse	Really?
Ryuse	Worked our pretty well tho
ITneko	Thats a nice looking torus!
narumi	that sounds like a terrible ideasay that to anime studios and youre fired
Panty	so u like it when they run out of animation budget and have to use 3d?
narumi	thats my point, they use 3d to cut cost to spend them on more important scenes later on
narumi	the fuck you getting sensitive for boi
Panty	but thats bad. just take a look at one piece.
Panty	the animation was good because it had a consistent budget
Panty	then it went shit for 3 years
Panty	and thier important scenes were dog shit
narumi	you know the studio also works on other anime
narumi	they dont just focus on one piece
narumi	look lets not debate over this
narumi	get yourself some rest
narumi	youre no chill
Panty	well
Panty	looks like youre wrong for now
Panty	it seems that its just one piece atm
narumi	atm yeah sure
Panty	but still. its fucking one piece the show that everyone cares about. and toei acts like its a generic isekai
Ryuse	Ufotable uses 3D a lot
Panty	yes
ITneko	Oney uses 3D a lot too!
Panty	but the point was using 3D elements in a drawing. it wouldnt work unless the object is stylised
Panty	idk guys @narumi is prolly right. but i would like to see more consistent budget in anime.
narumi	start buying blu rays
Mirai	I feel like drawing something again since i havent drawn anything in almost a year anyone got any suggestions on what i should draw?
Ryuse	@Airi Mirai Now
Ryuse	What u should draw is
Ryuse	whats in your heart
narumi	@Airi Mirai THATS MY OLD PFP AAA
narumi	draw patchouli
noa	There are plenty of artists tht mix 2d and 3D well
noa	Its hard but super admirable
Pleinair	hmm the whole point the 3D convo thing started was because i was showing an example of inio asano using unreal to actually do most of his scenes
Pleinair	so ya like mixing 2D and 3D is like acceptable
Pleinair	and trigger does it well too
Pleinair	promare has many 3D scenes with 2D characters animated
cxempion	Hellow fellow artists
Pleinair	o/
HirkaniBunny07	heyyy
noa	I think land of the lustrous does 3D pretty well
noa	It suits the style
noa	And yea! Ive seen the documentary with inio asano, its actually a rly helpful method
noa	And his work is so good

Delcina	getting a fever owo
Delcina	yes
Holy	Should i make a manga outa my oc?
Nitrogen	Try it. Good for experience
Nitrogen	Everything will suck at the start, but thats normal. Every pro was bad in the beginning
Holy	Yeah but it has lotsa details so i feel that it will take a month for a single chapter
Holy	Also story is important
Holy	I luv psychology so i wanna take it that route
Nitrogen	about 3040 pages per chapter a month, is normal
Holy	What?!?!?!?!?
Holy	Nooo i cant draw that many
Holy	My oc is super hard for me rn
Nitrogen	I think those guys use assistants tho
Holy	I made him today
Holy	Yep
Holy	Scroll up and u will see what im talking about when i say hard to drraw
Nitrogen	Not every page needs to be that detailed
Nitrogen	Take a look at a lot of different authors and you can take inspiration at how they do it
Holy	Hmm but i wanna make it look as good as possible if ima gonna do it
Holy	Hmm the authors i like use lotsa details tho
Holy	Homunculuss author puts in alotta time
Nitrogen	I wish you good luck
Nitrogen	Practice a lot
Holy	Oki ty
noa	You dont have to take it that fast
noa	Its actually much easier to go the manhwa/webtoon route
noa	Theyre a lot simpler than manga usually, and the formatting is a little more friendly for beginners

Mirai	@PinkC4ndy The drawing is NSFW since it has that thing on her face and since this server is SFW you cannot post anything that resembles NSFW including artworks, sorry.

KOANGEL	OOO nice me too
TOXiCAK1RA	WHERE ARE THEM DRAWINGS FOOL
Mehh	Can I do an art rant
Mehh	I am genuinely confused so I have a few questions
bishmia	sure!
Mehh	Ok
Mehh	Can somebody please explain to me
Mehh	why my professor is so stuck up on us working traditionally
Mehh	Specifically with graphite pencils
bishmia	i mean, before digital art, you have to master the pencil sketch and shading
Mehh	Why?
bishmia	im in art school and i have traditional art before i move on to even touch a tablet
bishmia	because its the basics
Mehh	Im not in art school per se, Im studying graphic design but we have applied drawing classes
bishmia	you cant move on to the harder things without knowing the basics, i mean technically you can
bishmia	but you wont have your full potential
Mehh	That doesnt really answer my question though
bishmia	youre asking why you have to draw tradition if you only draw digital right? its because digital is objectively easier i guess
bishmia	if you fuck up something, you can just undo
bishmia	id know
Mehh	Yes
Mehh	It doesnt smudge either
Mehh	And I can change brush sizes
Mehh	OH BEAUTIFUL BRUSH SIZES
Mehh	Do you know
Mehh	DO YOU KNOW
Mehh	HOW MANY STROKES
bishmia	so they want to help you with traditional art so you wont undo as much and youd have to actually master the pen and the pencil
Mehh	IT TAKES TO FILL AN A4 PAPER
Mehh	with a b6 graphite pencil
bishmia	no clue, never did that i guess
Mehh	Man we doing value studies, he wants us to break down pictures into values
Mehh	said pictures are supposed to include a full body figure
Mehh	and I have no problem with drawing that or the bg or anything
Mehh	But like
bishmia	sounds sweet
Mehh	Wtf
bishmia	its good practice honestly
Mehh	I could do that digitally too
Mehh	and much better
Mehh	It is, I dont mind the task itself
Mehh	I just mind that its traditional
bishmia	but you need to do that worse in traditional before you can move on to the easier stuff
bishmia	its a completely different skill set
bishmia	and they want to help you cover all bases even if your actual art is only digital
Mehh	Yeah thats one point taken
Mehh	But Im still a stubborn little prick cuz
Mehh	I was asking could I do digital art since september last year
Mehh	he wanted us to fill a 120 page sketchbook by the end of this school year in june
bishmia	how much time did you have for it?
Mehh	I filled up 100 pages by the end of last semester
Mehh	And then he said weeell since everyone complains that they dont know what to draw
Mehh	Then u have to draw 20 pages of figure, 20 of still life/drapery and 20 of gesture
Mehh	and that made about
Mehh	85 pages of my sketchbook invalid
Mehh	90 motivation
bishmia	but i guess since you did those parts, theyre already done
Mehh	Nah
Mehh	I had to start another sketchbook
bishmia	now you do some new stuff, sprinkle it around, dont focus on a certain thing
bishmia	bruh why didnt you tell your teacher or summin?
Mehh	And now I dont feel like drawing anymore and its half empty, I cant even fill in 40 pages A5, when last time I did 100 A4
bishmia	well quarantine also demotivates people
Mehh	Im tired of traditional art
Mehh	Uhm... Maybe it would demotivate normal people
Mehh	But quarantine was like my usual lifestyle
Mehh	Never leaving the house
Mehh	So yeah...
Mehh	the only thing demotivating me
Mehh	is that I have to spend hours upon hours doing careful little pencil strokes until I fill up an A4 paper
Mehh	AND I KNOW
Mehh	Im gonna say fook it and give up midway cuz my patience does not span that much
Mehh	Eeven though I can spend 12 hrs continuously drawing, spending 4hrs on just pencil strokes and then seeing the whole thing get smudged and making mistakes I cant erase
Mehh	drives me nuts
Mehh	If anyone has some tips for this please let me know
KOANGEL	None
KOANGEL	Omg quarantine is getting at you a lot, Im sorryyy,
bishmia	they said it wasnt quarantine so i dont know
Mehh	It just makes me wanna sit down and cry l
Mehh	I spent way too much time on 1 pencil drawing I hate and I hate it because it was obviously rushed and it was rushed and scribbled cuz my patience was gone
dudenaicu	bruh give the pencils a break
dudenaicu	theyre not that bad
Mehh	bruh if u saw the difference bw my traditional and digital art x.x
KOANGEL	I felt like that once,I forced myself to do something good, and i wasted a whole night
KOANGEL	My hand was cramped and my back hurt, and for some reason I was just so mad
KOANGEL	It was digital and my laptop kept freezing, I was so irritated tbh
dudenaicu	gg
Mehh	Im getting pissed off at a lot of things nowadays with the whole creative process
Mehh	I cant really draw what I want cuz Im too busy doing assignments
yubae	hii
Mehh	At the same time I cant really argue or hate the assignments since theyre making me leave my comfort zone
Mehh	And I feel like Im genuinely improving but because of that I hate me for hating it... u get where Im coming from?
Mehh	Also hi Yubae
dudenaicu	whats going on yubae
dudenaicu	@Mehh thats tuff dude
dudenaicu	maybe just chill
Mehh	sigh

dudenaicu	wanna art trade?
dudenaicu	or art collab or wtv
mlkky	how are we supposed to collab?
mlkky	from far away
narumi	you dont need to be close to collab tho xD
mlkky	im confused when you mean collab you mean working on the same piece together right?
dudenaicu	im pretty sure we all have access to wifi
mlkky	sorry im just dumb im just imagining how it would work im guessing its similar to google docs where its online and two users can make changes on their sides while using discord to speak with each other. what i mean though was how are you supposed to collab with physical art works not digital.
mlkky	forgot to clarify im guessing that its not possible or can you just trace or emulate art style from the other artist obviously with their permission would that also be a collaboration if it was done on both sides.
Smugi	None

Ryuse	Heres my latest vid
Delcina	like lofi hip hop beats
Delcina	lmao
mlkky	for new yt its not a good idea

Ryuse	part 1 is sketching and lining
Ryuse	2 is coloring
mlkky	i dont get how u do it bro
mlkky	her eyes look so nice
Ryuse	U can see how I do it in the vid
mlkky	seeing something doesnt mean i can do it
Ryuse	I started doing vids just in case someone wanna learn how I do stuff
mlkky	what program do u use?
Ryuse	SAI 2
mlkky	ohh
mlkky	i used to have sai on my laptop now i got a new one btw its recommended to use a touch pen right
Ryuse	I dont think the program matters tho
Ryuse	Like as long as u can see how its done it should be fine :3
mlkky	any tips for drawing anime characters heads
mlkky	like the shape
Ryuse	Hmm
Ryuse	Draw from real life
Ryuse	then alter
Ryuse	Jk
mlkky	droppping a bomb on me
noa	I mean thats def true tho
Ryuse	I was kidding about joking
Ryuse	so yeah
mlkky	im struggling with anime let alone real life
mlkky	ive tried to draw real life
Ryuse	Well u can just draw a circle
Ryuse	set the direction
mlkky	ye
Ryuse	draw face
noa	Doing studies helps heaps
Delcina	woo
mlkky	hmm is it a good idea to use references or nah
Delcina	too many commission request just one of me w
Delcina	aaa
noa	Find artists you look up to and try replicating the skull shape
Ryuse	Use references
Ryuse	Too many comm requests?
noa	References helps def when ur learning
Ryuse	Thats good
noa	I dont use them bc Im lazy
Ryuse	U can make a waiting list
Delcina	but then
Ryuse	or increase ur prices
noa	good luck tama
mlkky	i wanna draw strictly anime so is using real life references or anime references the better choice
Delcina	no more time for girl
noa	Def increase ur prices for sure
noa	Ur worth a lot more
Ryuse	Best way to cut down comms is to increase price
Delcina	naww
Ryuse	Or just close comms :3
Ryuse	Like I did
noa	Both psycho
Delcina	thats not how I do
Delcina	lmao
Ryuse	I decided I just wanna enjoy art
mlkky	have you guys seen my line art?
noa	U still need to know basic real life anatomy n how stuff to replicate it in anime
Ryuse	monetizing it ruins it for me for some reason
mlkky	true
noa	I feel that ryuse
Delcina	owo
mlkky	does it make it a job rather than enjoyment
noa	Id love to make money but doing commissions specifically stresses me out
Delcina	isnt that why we draw for ourselves from time to time
noa	I only do it whenever Im struggling
mlkky	cause if you stuff up the client will be unhappy
Delcina	its like an art to make yourself appreciate your skills more owo
noa	Id rather draw fanart and print my own prints and charms like AA artists do
Ryuse	If Im gonna make money from art its gonna be from my Patreon and Youtube
Ryuse	kek
noa	And make money off that
noa	You can make hundreds to thousands off AA tables
noa	And I dont even gotta draw anything u arent interested in

soon	lul
soon	there is art
soon	but you have to scroll up
Kawamel	Or u go to artwork
VarvTer	hi
dudenaicu	drawing legs and feet is 10x harder than drawing hands and arms
dudenaicu	getting the proportions right is even harder holy shit
soon	rlly
soon	its the opposite for me lmao
KJ	tbh ive never even attempted
KJ	except like shoes
KJ	its hard
here	Is it rough even with references to the side? never forget those!
here	also hello, im looking for artists /writers that are interested in an event i aim to host next month where i will post a 1 to 3 word prompt daily with a 24h lock into the next prompt, like a daily challenge! its meant to stimulate creativity in a fast paced manner, but no harm if you wish to skip days of course
darky	hi
Kawamel	Im so nervous
Kawamel	I published my first speedpaint of my oc on youtube
KOANGEL	AAA hi guys
KOANGEL	Woah hella onigiris
KOANGEL	Anyways so I wanna do the sakura outfit contest but Im so busy
None	It ends around June 1, you have enough time if you manage your time ouo
soon	there arent that many entries honestly
Flavie	Im gonna enter!
Flavie	I looove character design
Flavie	@Orange Juice 🍊💦Not here I am interested!
here	Hello! ah i hope linking things is allowed here?
here	here is the announcement post, twitter version.its only done through twitter and tumblr sadly else I may get disorganised
A	OwO
KOANGEL	OOO okay ty
here	remember its just for fun so no rush if you miss any days! I will do a RNG raffle since its meant to be a quantity over quality event after all!
here	and if theres any questions just ask
Flavie	Do we just have to post our drawing or do we need to do something special to enter?
here	hmmm for organisation/spread purposes, id say post under the special hashtag i will announce but ALSO please link your post with the completed prompt to the google docs, in order to gain points to qualify for the art raffle you must complete either 10 prompts before the daily challenge expires the next day or 5 cooperated prompts!
here	the hashtag one is mainly optional, if i cannot find it at the end of the challenge it may not count towards the raffle and thatd be a shame
Flavie	If its on Twitter its fine I think
Flavie	But thx it looks exciting so Im in
Flavie	because Im bored too
here	glad to hear!
Delcina	@Kawamel can you dm me the link?
Delcina	to your speedpaint
Kawamel	Sure !

Delcina	Hello, my friend is wanting to make a video talking about styles when drawing, but no one wanted to help him. Do you think you could redraw this and send it to your Twitter profile or me if you dont have it?
Delcina	I think Ive already written
Delcina	None
Delcina	It doesnt have to be complete and well done...
Delcina	Can be a sketch, as long as they show their style
Delcina	Obviously not mandatory, but if you can help him, I would be very happy
None	Although this suggestion is a lot of work, but your friend can try drawing in different styles as a challenge. I think there were quite many artists whove done that before
Delcina	Yeah, I know. I even told her that this looked like he was asking for free commissions and that no one would do it, which happened. In the end I felt sorry and wanted to help him
Delcina	None
None	Yeah... I get that v maybe you should persuade him into doing it, so his video wouldnt be prolonged? Itll also be a good way for him to advance his skills owo and maybe hell be surprised by it?
Delcina	Sure, Ill try to. Though Im sure he wont listen to me... n
None	TuT well hopefully he does... especially since he needs to reconsider it
Delcina	I hope so too...

JeanV88	can anyone tell me how to post an image here?
PinkC4ndy	can anyone help me with some problem?
PinkC4ndy	The sakura tree behind her is transparent, the coloring I use different app Inkscape, but the shading I use Medibang.
itqmi	medibang is good
itqmi	hmm..
itqmi	worst come to worst, you could just erase that part of teh sakura layer
itqmi	oh
itqmi	i know
itqmi	combine the hair with the closest 100 opacity layer that below it
itqmi	it should solve the problem
itqmi	but idk
itqmi	@PinkC4ndy
PinkC4ndy	every layer opacity is 100
itqmi	hmm..
itqmi	then i guess u will just have to erase the sakura behind here
itqmi	only that part
itqmi	i cant think of any other solution
itqmi	its also the fastest
itqmi	since searching for help for long will just waste time
itqmi	lmao
itqmi	sry
itqmi	but this is teh only solution i can think of
itqmi	@PinkC4ndy
itqmi	oh w8
itqmi	u used water color right
itqmi	None
itqmi	then thats it
itqmi	water color has a low opacity
itqmi	wet is 40 opacity
itqmi	not wet is i forgot
itqmi	but it looks like u used wet.
itqmi	oh w8
itqmi	u used anotehr site to color
PinkC4ndy	I use airbrush btw
itqmi	oh
itqmi	ok
oogam	@PinkC4ndy? what you trying to do with sakura tree? do you want it to be infront of her or?
itqmi	oh yea
itqmi	it also depends on wot u want to do with it
itqmi	muckan?
PinkC4ndy	the one under is behind her
PinkC4ndy	the other one is in front of her
oogam	i understand. what are you trying to fix with the behind her sakura tree?
itqmi	then what i said still applies
itqmi	i think he wants the hair to not be tranparent or something
oogam	if dont want to show the sakura tree overlapping with her hair then...jus erase the parts. or recolor the hair. i think its best to do coloring and shading in the same programmedibang is good for coloring...and. everything.
itqmi	yea
itqmi	but i think erasing the parts would be more ideal
PinkC4ndy	hmmm ok ill try your advice
PinkC4ndy	oh btw the sakura isnt my drawing, its a picture I took from internet
PinkC4ndy	but luckily, you know what? the solution is simple. It can be erased
itqmi	None
itqmi	ok
itqmi	good luck bro

urabrubraka	So Im kinda stuck, and I kinda need inspiration how do u guys usually come up with ideas for OCs and whats your techniques in creating one?@DevZest hmm i got inspired from other charcters
urabrubraka	For example my oc has a vibe like shoto and stuff
urabrubraka	And basically i try to think of a story for them
DevZest	Im not very creative with coming up with storys
nyako	i just look at color palettes
urabrubraka	You can like think of a story first and then create a character
urabrubraka	Hmm like for me i watched really good shows and tried to make my own
DevZest	How do u usually get your motivation for a story?
urabrubraka	With like a sad background story and such
urabrubraka	To be more connected with the character
DevZest	I mean I feel like everything I think of just become an anime Ive watched
DevZest	None
urabrubraka	Maybbe
urabrubraka	Combine your fav animes in one yk
urabrubraka	Like take inspiration in like all ofem
sopbusgaming	hmmm what a interesting idea
sopbusgaming	even though am terrible at drawing
urabrubraka	Thats how i basicallly kinda did
sopbusgaming	i cant barely draw a gaster blaster let alone draw sans
urabrubraka	I was like thinkin back then
urabrubraka	Wow i why isnt there like a main character as a woman who is also like really strong and unique powers
urabrubraka	Im sure there is but like yk back then i was like hmmm
sopbusgaming	hmm yeah
urabrubraka	And then i made like out of that my own oc yk
sopbusgaming	my drawing limit is block people
sopbusgaming	like square people
sopbusgaming	thats how terrible i am

Akaishio	its just bad advice in general
Akaishio	because in order to draw something u have to look at it
YesArtist	i now its rude
Akaishio	I mean u cant draw if ur eyes are closed
Akaishio	and it would only limit the artist into drawing their own hands
iLikeTrains	no he said that for hands u should use ur own hand
iLikeTrains	not for everything
Akaishio	its not rude but like in my opinion its a bad advice
pet	imagine trying to draw a hand but the piece of paper keeps moving because youre using your own hand as a reference

Akaishio	teriffic painting I must say although I am not quite sure if its your artstyle but I think u could render the image much more sharper if u put more contrast in the shadows of the feathers

Akaishio	thats just me t ho
Akaishio	but overall Good JOB
Akaishio	hng

Hinafuyama	could you help me, i have been drawing with paint tool sai for a long time but since i didnt buy it ,often it does not open etc ... so i will choose to buy it but many people have told me to use clip studio paint which is much better for the manga style both have almost the same price and I dont know which one to choose ... Its been 1 year since I used pts but apparently cps is better
Akaishio	u could
Akaishio	pirate it
Akaishio	👀
Hinafuyama	No thats what i did with pts and my software just crash all time
Akaishio	oh no
Akaishio	hmm
Hinafuyama	if i buy 1 of the 2 i would never have any problem again but i dont know which one take
Akaishio	it depends on u
Akaishio	its suppose to be where u are much more comfortable with
Akaishio	ifu like sai more then choose sai
Akaishio	if u like the other one then choose it
Hinafuyama	yeah youre right
Akaishio	yeet

None	@ Hinafuyama it depends on what youre doing, but I would suggest cps because it allows custom brushes, other features that are not available in pts 3D modeling, panels, etc. Pts is good for the basics, but if you want something more advance and diverse, then cps all the way.

rin	youre the type of person all the artists love
narumi	None
Bussandharry1	plus i wanted to know if it would actually cost anything
narumi	depends on the simple
rin	yeah even a stick man drawing is valuable
rin	as long as effort was put in it
narumi	if its the random scribble you sent yesterday then it worths nothing honestly
rin	well you have a point
rin	I mean a professional simple doodle
Bussandharry1	oh no, that picture was going to be my hair which i failed at instantly
Bussandharry1	simple as in this
rin	So no shadings just lineart and flat colors
narumi	random scribble

Bussandharry1	i have no idea about anything related to art so ima say yes
rin	well that depends on the artists style
Bussandharry1	true

Delcina	you can use Vellum board as well owo
Mehh	Anyone here got any tips on shading realism in colour?
Delcina	never use black owo
Delcina	you can use a color, opposite to the base color
Delcina	like with red
Delcina	you can use a darker shade of blue to show 3D realism uwu
Delcina	if you want more depth, add more dark
Delcina	if you want more volume, use lighter colors
Mehh	Oh yeah
Mehh	Bounced light
Delcina	for highlights, you can use yellow, light blue or orange to set the environmental light owo
Delcina	it depends on what time of the day or what background youre going for
Delcina	it should be the same color as the background
Mehh	Doesnt that depend on the color of the thing youre shading? Like for example, yellow light, skin, blue hair, red shirt,The red shirt would have orangish to yellow highlights,Blue hair should be leaning to green and almost yellow, but not quite there yet, and skin should have peachy to really light yellow?

Mehh	Can somebody tell me how I can make my art style not be all over the place???
Mehh	Like none of these match
Mehh	I dont mind 1 or two standing out if I do realism or sth
Mehh	But boiii
A	Theyre all unique its good
Mehh	ALL of em have differently drawn eyes/faces/noses etc
Mehh	None
Mehh	But my art feels like its getting worse x.x
Blanc.Usagi	I have this same issue, what i tried is having a picture of a drawing in the style i want to be consistent of next to me when i draw so i know how to train my eye to always draw in that style
Blanc.Usagi	And ref sheets for your style you want helps too. Like have the style of eye shapes etc.
jayck34	@Mehh consistency is the answer, dude
jayck34	but its okay
jayck34	i also struggle with that

Reddy	None
HaloPhantomEx	wip
HaloPhantomEx	question is there a way to get smoother/cleaner lines
HaloPhantomEx	None
ShigeQQ	Aside from utilizing stabilization if any exists in your application and making sure youre using a brush thats sensitive to pressure adjusts its line weight and width, CTRLZ at least five times for every line there is on your drawing.
ShigeQQ	No, Im not exaggerating. 🙂
Doggos	I think... thats traditional?
Doggos	pardon me if Im wrong.
ShigeQQ	It /was/ traditional. They traced over their traditional sketch which was photographed and pasted onto a canvas. Not uncommon for those who feel more comfortable sketching on paper.
HaloPhantomEx	Im originally a traditional artis but trying to get inti digital. And is world stabilizer what your talking about?
ShigeQQ	Just stabilization your stroke will lag slightly behind your pen to correct your lines and soften wobbliness
HaloPhantomEx	oh ok
Greyald	Hello, anyone know how to fix this white spot on the line? I use ibispaint x

Armannamra	k
Mehh	Anyone else get annoyed when people start flooding 1015 of their drawings at once?..
HaloPhantomEx	no
HaloPhantomEx	still working on it. any other methods of shading instead of making a bunch of mask layers for shading..
Mehh	Uh... Making mask layers isnt really a method for shading
Mehh	Or well at least not the technique
Mehh	You could just do everything in 1 layer
Mehh	Wont change your shading style much
narumi	laughs in 200 layers
Mehh	Usually when Im painting I have fewer layers than when Im cell shading, if it helps
narumi	well youre pAInTing
Mehh	Yes
Mehh	I expected to use more layers
Mehh	For it though
narumi	painting doesnt need that many layes since you just paint over everything
Mehh	Cuz Im scared of makin mistakes and all
Mehh	Yeah
narumi	and you said using mask layer isnt a method youre wrong
narumi	well just different opinion i wont judge
Mehh	I corrected myself and said technique
narumi	well? its still a technique
Mehh	Technique for me is where you place those shadows, how detailed are they, what strokes do you use, etc
narumi	if you have multiple characters in a canvas its easier for each has their own mask layer to not confuse one and other
narumi	and the tools you use, which is mask layer
Mehh	Cant really say I can consider it a tool but ok x.x
Mehh	And yeah layers do make things easier
Mehh	Dont know why youre trying to run away from them if theyre at your disposition
narumi	run away from what
Mehh	Using masks
Mehh	The person asked is there other ways to shade
Mehh	U can
narumi	because theyre not used to it?
narumi	layers are confusing if you dont know how they work
narumi	considering hes still new
narumi	@HaloPhantomEx you can use clipping layer or alpha lock on ibis paint
Mehh	l
Mehh	You gonna have to learn one way or another
Mehh	Not knowing is gonna limit ya...
narumi	I mean thats why he asked
Mehh	Dude...
narumi	yes?
Mehh	Nvm it sigh
Mehh	Just look up some tutorials there isnt a thing that doesnt have a tutorial nowadays
Mehh	Each layer is practically adding like an invisible sheet that only records and shows the things you draw on it
narumi	are you explaining it to me or
Mehh	No
narumi	ah gotchu
Mehh	sigh
Mehh	Anyhow
Mehh	If youre unsatisfied with how you drew something on one layer you can just delete it or clear it or hide it
Mehh	Hiding it will still keep your drawing intact, so you can draw multiple things, but if you feel like the first thing you drew was best after all you can just hide the other layers and keep the one from before
Mehh	If that makes sense
Mehh	Clearing layers will reset them to a blank canvas, usually just by pressing the delete button on your keyboard
Mehh	And deleting the layer will completely remove everything on canvas and the canvas itself
Mehh	Learn how to name and organise them and put them all in a folder to make things easier for you
Mehh	If layers really were the problem
Mehh	If you just dont want to use many of them then just draw on less?
HaloPhantomEx	I ment clipping layers my b
Mehh	That still doesnt tell me much at all
Mehh	You can just not use them literally
Mehh	You can limit yourself to 1 layer, 2 or 3
Mehh	Or you can make a new layer for every stroke if you want
Mehh	Still not rly gonna help you improve your shading...
HaloPhantomEx	I mean like a simpler way using clipping layers is the method i use but then it gets unorganized and u end up with a crap tone of layers.
Mehh	Then u dont need a new way to shade but a way to organise
Mehh	If I feel like I have too many layers and Im satisfied with where Im going
Mehh	I just merge them into 1
Mehh	Or two
Mehh	Or just.. Less
HaloPhantomEx	thank you feel bad for asking a stupid question like this. I wanted to see how others do their shading bc i see some ppl use the gradient tool. Or just fill the art work in with a darker shade then erase where light hits the said object. And i wanted to find a simpler method of doing it
ShigeQQ	You gonna have to learn one way or anotherI really dislike this approach toward telling someone how to improve at art yes, while many artists advance themselves through their knowledge of their program, some choose to forge their own techniqueone that may seem unconventional to others, but can be applied effectively on their own works and can be improved upon.He doesnt need to abandon masks to learn how to shade, just as how I dont need to use glow effects for highlights. Its an option. Not a requirement.
ShigeQQ	Uh... Making mask layers isnt really a method for shading Or well at least not the techniqueAnything can be a technique. If masking his layers functions as part of a process regarding his shading, it qualifies as his technique.
ShigeQQ	@HaloPhantomEx Dont feel bad, and dont limit yourself to a single suggestion. Explore, experiment, and addend to your process as you see fit, whether it be how comfortable you are with it or the quality of your work.
HaloPhantomEx	Ok ill try that
None	doodles

Panty	@ShigeQQ had to do some digging to see your art. it looks pretty pro for a manga. you should do them for better or for worse. if you think they arent good. rather than not doing it just charge minimum price?
ShigeQQ	I dont like having to deal with deadlines
ShigeQQ	contests I take interest in are an exception
