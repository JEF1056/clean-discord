['Cloudy']: I post at least every week Ryuse KOANGEL/bKama: ill post my Serpent Pillar artwork tomorrow./b['Ryuse']: My works take a long time/nkek/b['Cloudy']: Yeah I understand./bKama: heyo Cloud./b['Ryuse']: cuz Im lazy/b['Cloudy']: Hii/b['KOANGEL']: Ryuseee duuudee, your work is really nice bc of the fact you actually finish/nYoo/b['Ryuse']: Hmm/nThose are my old works tho/b['KOANGEL']: I have a question for the both of you/nHow did you get commissions easily? Or at all, Im bad at it,/nI want money heck/b['Ryuse']: I dont/b['Cloudy']: Uhh no. its difficult especially with my small following/bKama: heyo Ryuse/b['Cloudy']: I do get some tho/b['Ryuse']: Hai Ri/b['KOANGEL']: Is it from ppl u know or followers more/b['Ryuse']: I used to do em but now I dont XD/nCuz I want freedom/b['KOANGEL']: Get that ryuse yes/b['Cloudy']: More from people I know?/b['KOANGEL']: And ah okay/nNo its whatever, I just gotta grow more, this shii hard/b['Cloudy']: It takes time
['Ryuse']: Hmm/nI would suggest/njust getting better at art first/nI know this sounds generic but it really is true/nYou gotta set the expectation for others/nabout what they will get when they commission you/nThen afterwards its the pricing/nThen after you set the price you market/nMarketing is often overlooked/nbut is essential/nBut marketing and setting the price wont matter much if our art is subpar/nso we gotta keep our art quality up/nthats just from my experience/b['Pleinair']: its also how you practice
['Pleinair']: try drawing the same thing in a different way or method, line art isnt for everyone/nand dont always stuck on trying to have a set style/nbut if you do, dont be afraid to explore and develop on it, rather than be fixated and using it as an excuse to not get better/nalso try doing drawing sessions with friends/ni mentioned this before but drawpile is a great way to do that, if you dont do digital, just being in call together and setting aside even 1 hr of your time with friends is enough for you to lear/b['KOANGEL']: Ryuse Pleinair wow thats helpful, all is true too thank tysmm/b['QIQI']: for me its kinda hard for a new artist to start to get tons of commission since theres alot of good competitors. Marketing is my strategy. i try to get involve in many community share my artwork and improve at the same time. You wont get good result for a few couple of months. But slowly you will get followers who like your art./b['KOANGEL']: Oh boy, I really gotta bring up my game then, and collaborate with others yeah./b['QIQI']: If youre marketing arent good, no matter how beautiful your art is, no onewill notice. The easiest way to start to get followers or anyone to even look at your drawing is to draw some mainstream stuff. very cliche but it work. Once you get followers you can draw anything and people will like it/b['KOANGEL']: Im patient but it sucks how it takes a while if so/nHmmm mainstream, okay/b['QIQI']: patient is the key success take time! But you can do it!!! Yeh draw mainstream is the easiest way to gain popularity/nfrom my experience/b['KOANGEL']: Somth ppl will like is easy and hard,/nOkay, thank you mogu!/b['Ryuse']: Mogu share your social media link/b['KOANGEL']: O right, I didnt see you work mogu, if u want ofc/nYour/b['QIQI']: me I just started using my social this year so theres nothing much/nmy work/b['KELLY']: bruh we talking about insta or something/b['QIQI']: i wish i can share/ncant share image/ndont know how the server roles work tbh/b['Ryuse']: You can share links here iirc/nwhats your exp?/b['QIQI']: I just got here two days ago/nI send an artwork for the sakura contest/b['KOANGEL']: Oh idk Im sure should have around I think 500 xp to be able I post images in artwork chat/b['QIQI']: you can find my insta in sakura onsen insta, they tag me/b['Ryuse']: Found it/nHeres your work iirc/b['QIQI']: ot sure aswell, since im new but Ill figure out somehow/nyeh thats mine/b['Ryuse']: Lood/b['Cloudy']: Looks great!

['Ryuse']: Also/nMarketing campains/nseo/nmarket segmenting/nYeah more theory/nits boring but it helps/b['QIQI']: it actually help tbh. since i learn the same thing in my school/b['KOANGEL']: Its cool to know here bc, its like behind the scenes, and not a yt vid where it feels harder to do/b['Ryuse']: I once met an artist for Azur Lane/ncalled her senpai and she loves drawing big boobs/nShes always staying up late to draw XD/nBut damn she draws fast and her drawings are really good/b['QIQI']: pro man, I wannabe like that one day, fast but masterpiece/b['Pleinair']: hmm
['Pleinair']: ya watching others draw or show their technique is a good way to learning as well/nsince you get a grasp of a workflow you could practice/b['Taichi']: how to be pro in anatomy real quick!
['Ryuse']: Watch pro/nez/b['Peachy', 'Sol']: Ehhh/nIs someone in here traditional drawing?/b['skhema']: A Peachy Sol I do traditional... Ok I do both actually, but lines always traditional.

['bubbletea']: I wish I could draw like that/b['foxburton99']: Does anyone know how to get the artist role and the role for posting images in artwork?\nIm new here
['is', 'cat🐱']: so you need 500xp to post image/b['BakaBot']: or the artist role/b['is', 'cat🐱']: and the artist role is basically saying that you are an artist/nand to get one by posting at the artwork or maybe ask from a mod/nthats all i know/b['BakaBot']: you can ask mods but you have to send a pic as evidence/b['foxburton99']: Is there a channel for asking mods stuff like this or do I need to DM?/b['BakaBot']: dms are fine/nat least for me/b['foxburton99']: Thank you/nOh I didnt realize you were a mod. Should I send you just one piece of art?/b['BakaBot']: sure/b['foxburton99']: Kk just a moment/b['skhema']: munzhine Uhm, sorry about your confidence ! But honestly it so subjective... Every style is beautiful. And all pieces of art are a lot work.\nthank you for positive reactio

Kawaii character are not my main subject./b['Pleinair']: well some styles will always get more attention than others tbf/b['skhema']: Yes this is absolutely right!

Anatomy is right.\nIt is a bit horror./b['bread']: i cant seem to post anything in the artwork channel/b['Pleinair']: hm? just ideas i been exploring/b['bread']: do you know how i fix this?/b['skhema']: About how to post at art channel is conversation above/nso you need 500xp to post image\nwaaa is cat🐱 One need level or the role to post pics/b['is', 'cat🐱']: yup/b['skhema']: I think it is a good idea to include it to general info or rules, so not everyone is asking/b['is', 'cat🐱']: you have an artist role so you can post even if you dont have 500xp/nyou can make a suggestio/b['skhema']: right/b['crestfalle']: You could send me your artwork/nAnd I could give you the role/nLmao why did that sound weird/nI swear its not supposed to sound weird/b['Pleinair']: but ya been been playing around with designs to think about developing some styles/nthe 2nd one was more for like a game character desig/nsimplistic to do and easy to animate in the long ru/nwhile giving enough information about a character while maintain a memorable form/silhouette/nbread ooo you did the background?/b['bread']: got my art posted now

['Tensai']: ice/b['Ryuse']: Hmm
['Ryuse']: It seems that time has come agai/nwhere Ive no motivation to do anything/b['Op.Cyclone']: go do it without motivatio/b['Mochi']: thats me 24/7
['d.ellis.b']: I dont have an anime pfp so what does that mea/ninstant coffee for two or something else?/b['Hensa']: why did you guys submit so many
['is', 'cat🐱']: OwO/b['Armannamra']: hen sleepu/b['Hensa']: Judging 100 good works of art/nI only expected 50/b['Armannamra']: lemme send one more/b['Hensa']: you get 0 points arma/b['is', 'cat🐱']: good luck he/b['Armannamra']: shit/nworrh a try/b['Ryuse']: Hensan Remember to take a break when u need it kek
['Ryuse']: Theres like 28k people/nI was expecting like 30/b['is', 'cat🐱']: Dam/b['QIQI']: hemm Pleinair Aaliyajajaja I did tried to engage in a different coloring style, more crosshatching rather then blending but yeh., I choose different approach on the color too/b['Pleinair']: hm, i mean kikis present work, shows that understanding of hard light even more by presenting a glimmer and a more darker shadow on the hair, ofc imo your adjusting and exploring techniques./b['QIQI']: true true/b['Pleinair']: cuz a different stylization in rendering would be much more drastic in how you apply the tones and lighting imo/nlike aiming for a realistic look vs a more quick and simple with hardcolors/b['Aaliyajajaja']: Ah I see./b['QIQI']: tones and shades are my weakness. Imjust bad at choosing the right one. I notice that when Im looking at my old drawing,the color too vibrant sometime that it doesnt look natural. So I tried to go with a more again idk the word but like pale ish color. But like Cat said maybe I should add more shade on the skin to give more depth/b['Pleinair']: ya i feel ya pal! been experimenting with colors lately/nyou can add a multiply layer/nto do the extra tone/b['QIQI']: I saw some artist do that, but i just dont understand how it work./nthe color doesnt show much when I change it to multiply/b['Aaliyajajaja']: I dont struggle with shades and tones as much because I mostly use watercolor and I think thats fairly easy./b['Pleinair']: are you using the same color?/b['QIQI']: Aaliyajajaja oh you more to traditional?/b['Pleinair']: when using a mulitply layer/b['QIQI']: Pleinair nope a different shade ofcourse/ndo I need to use the same color?/b['Pleinair']: different layer, use same color/b['Ryuse']: QIQI what art style are you aiming for?/b['QIQI']: ouh really/b['Aaliyajajaja']: QIQI been using it for 8 years almost :3/b['QIQI']: me? Oh my aim are very high/b['Ryuse']: Example?
['QIQI']: Aaliyajajaja woww, I remember I was so into watercolor and color pencil back then, but now that I got my tablet, I abandon traditional and I now I have to restart all over again cause my skills are agone./b['Aaliyajajaja']: I absolutely cannot use digital lmao/b['QIQI']: example, hemmm maybe mmimmzel or ryota. If you look at how they approach their artwork, they use a more pale kinda color, but have this shiny bit shade that idk how the heck they do it./nlike around the hair or eyes. I know its multiply or glow or overlay someth,.. but I can never figure out how to make it look natural/b['Pleinair']: hmm ya i think colors are one of my weaknesses as well/b['Ryuse']: Oh/b['Pleinair']: im not consistent with everything on the canvas/b['Ryuse']: Can I see a piece?/nCuz I believe having a clear goal in art will help you improve fast/b['QIQI']: yeh I know that, Im an art student and we need alot of reference from any of our favorite artists. and I mean alot that we have a book full of just reference pictures from google. lmao./b['Ryuse']: Hmm I see/nI think I know what style youre aiming for now/b['QIQI']: yeh, I change my artstyle every 35months, till I figure out my own artstyle./nRyuse yeh, like the 2 artists that I mentio/b['Pleinair']: imo you could always just change it every moment, depending on what content/theme you are going for/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: ay, speaking of style. could someone take a look at some of my pieces?\nidk what style id fall under/b['QIQI']: It take time but Im sure Ill get there one day, i just started digitally december last year anyway/b['Pleinair']: sure/nGerkek Commissions OPEN/b['QIQI']: Pleinair trueee/b['Ryuse']: Anime probably/b['Pleinair']: that way kiki, you can pick things you like and wanna express/emphasize/nwell anime has many styles/ntbf/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: ill dm ya 😄/b['Pleinair']: anime is liek a general label people use/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: Ryuse wanna take a look? u/b['QIQI']: sure Gerkek Commissions OPEN,anime, semi realism, I can experiment anyone of them
['Ryuse']: Eh/nGet an artist role :3/nI only tried semirealism once/nI mostly do anime/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: o, howd i go get the role? 😮/b['Pleinair']: i mean most anime styles semirealistic/b['Ryuse']: Send a mod a message/b['Pleinair']: otherwise you wouldnt bother going for humanistic proportions/b['Ryuse']: send them your work/b['Pleinair']: for instance/b['QIQI']: my interpretation of semi realism if the use of shade to make it look almost 3d/nbut that is also truee/b['Pleinair']: ghibili studios style uses less on the facial structure/nand more on the bodylanguage/nmost of their characters arent intricately detailed/b['Ryuse']: This is what I consider semi realism/b['Pleinair']: until they want the character to have certain expressive traits/b['QIQI']: for animation you cannot focus on details anyway, thats why some anime nowadays use 3D because their character have tooo many details. for example lovelive/b['Pleinair']: then you have animes like bkub which are more designed to be memeish/nand have a different focus/nofc anime and drawing are different but the concept applies/nto both disiciplines/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: aayyee, i got it/nok, so what style would i fall under?/b['Pleinair']: you got a very western design approach imo/b['Ryuse']: I would say semi/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: hmmm/b['Pleinair']: more of a deviantart/tumblr artist kind/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: ew w/nwas never a fan of the tumblr style thing/b['Pleinair']: hmm nothing wrong with those imo, theres many people who are willing to commission through there, from what i hear/b['QIQI']: yeh youre style more focus on western with the very sharp outline and erm solid colors
['Mochi']: yea its more of a western style/b['Yato']: helo/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: ye i do pretty much only use solid colors, pretty much no blending/b['Pleinair']: but ya sorry if thats what you didnt wanna hear/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: well idk what would be a deviantart style, and i dont see the tumblr. but then again i wouldnt know the characteristics of that either,/b['Ryuse']: I think Plei just means wester/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: its the thicker lines and solid colors that makes it feel western right?/b['Ryuse']: Its more of the head structure/b['Pleinair']: I think its the rendering/b['Ryuse']: Than the body/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: rendering? o.o/b['Pleinair']: The colors I guess/b['mart']: huh/b['Ryuse']: Really?/not the structure/b['Pleinair']: I mean it could also be that too/nIts not a simple you gotta change one thing/nType if deal/b['Ryuse']: Cuz his rendering could also be applied to anime/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: heres one thats a few months old/b['mart']: thats really good/b['Ryuse']: Thats more anime before/b['Pleinair']: Id still say it looks wester/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: ty mart and i think i use to do lines back then differently
['Commissions', 'OPEN']: at one point i started to duplicate the line layer and blur it/nidk it made things pop?/b['Ryuse']: Have u tried like/ncoloring your lines?/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: actually, my lines are slightly colored/b['Ryuse']: Slight eh/nAlright/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: i dont think ive ever used pure black, on lines or shadows/b['Ryuse']: Nice/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: lines are usually Purple , Red, or Blue. just verrryyy dark/b['Ryuse']: I see/nI usually change the color of the lines/naccording to the object/b['Pleinair']: Hm/nCould add some brighter tones too/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: idk why my montergirls get purple, my cyborgs get blue, and my warriors get red/b['Ryuse']: Well as long as it looks good I think all is well/b['Pleinair']: Color coding perhaps?/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: hmmm/b['arumi']: ive no idea what style would you like to try but heres my lineart closeup just in case it helps
['arumi']: this was a year ago btw/b['Armannamra']: arumi make gud art/b['QIQI']: well then again western or anime, thin or thick, it is part of your style./b['Ryuse']: I like drawing cute stuff/nSo I try to make my pieces as adorable as possible/b['QIQI']: Gerkek Commissions OPEN your anatomy are pretty good though./b['Ryuse']: Anatomy or proportion?/b['QIQI']: anatomy/b['Ryuse']: I see/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: ty 😄/b['Ryuse']: Gerkek Commissions OPEN oh right is there a reason why you joined this server for commissions?/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: i just joined , id consider a comm, kinda full now atm/nhopefully not for long B/b['Ryuse']: Hmm I see/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: Neglecting my monstergirls .../b['Pleinair']: wut kind of monstergirls u draw/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: got a moth, a yeti, tall fish alien thingy/nand a Sadakoesque ghost whose a couch potato/nPleinair theres my moth, Ayla 😄/b['Ryuse']: The only monster girl Ive drawn is probably just a dragon girl/nAlso a ram/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: ooo, share? 0 u0/b['Ryuse']: Ram/nThen dragon girl/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: ooo, watch 😄/b['Ryuse']: Thank you XD/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: aaand followed. lets get you to that 1k o
['Pleinair']: oo mothgirls/nice/b['Ryuse']: It will be soon XD/b['Drakeanor']: Im thinking about drawing Sakura fox form in future
['Drakeanor']: She is 420 y.o, so she will have 5 tails/nAnd Sakura is a friendly girl, so cant really give her fire ball like the fox in Naruto/nher main color is green so maybe power of healing?/b['Panty']: i need some tips for line art, they always looks so flat and i cant properly weigh it like other artists. some advice would really help/b['Drakeanor']: my line art sux so cant give advice/nif you go digital, maybe reduce the density/nfor example, i use 3040 density for 710 size brush/ndamn, I feel like idiot.../b['Panty']: Drakeanor what application do you use and ty
['Drakeanor']: Clip studio paint/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: OOO, Drakeanor , recently got that, i love it 😄
['Commissions', 'OPEN']: you tried the vector line stuff?/b['QIQI']: I use csp but I never use the vector, idk how to use it
['AnDReeD']: how hand do draw/nYes/nWhat/b['Ryuse']: AnDReeD hand go fwoom bwoom
['Ryuse']: swish swish/nfap fap/nswiss wish/b['AnDReeD']: Thank/b['Ryuse']: Np/b['Mochi']: QIQI the vector layer is basically the same as raster layer but you can edit your lines
['Mochi']: You get these 4 extra tools/nUuh I dont really know how to explain them so just try messing around with them/b['elixiink']: I really want to post an artwork that Ive been working on hours for feedback TT but I need the dango role
['BakaBot']: you can dm a mod and ask if they give you the role they need a pic as evidence tho elixiink/b['Flavie']: Hi
['Flavie']: Also for the person struggling with lineart/nMaybe the setting of your pen I mean the actual pen your holding is bad/nYou can go in brush environment settings and make it less or more sensitive/nAt least it helped me/b['elixiink']: BakaBot Thanks for letting me know! Ill try contacting one of them
['elixiink']: Thank you chaga!/b['Commissions', 'OPEN']: imo, the best feature of a vector layer is that resizing them doesnt cause them to go blurry, they stay sharp/b['CreamBootyAss']: i made this
['Ryuse']: Vectors as scalable/nwhich is awesome/b['Flavie']: I dont have the vector tool on my app/nIm sad it looks so cool/b['CreamBootyAss']: have u listened to my song i made?
['Flavie']: Actually I really like the beat/nWould be so good with a good rap on top/b['Drakeanor']: what is vector
['QIQI']: Mochi ahh I see, so vector layer is better than normal one?or it useless, cause I never see any benefit of it, maybe im blind/b['Mochi']: QIQI I recommend using it if youre doing lineart/nYou cant use layer mask on vector layers though/b['QIQI']: Mochi hooo 00 I see, Ill try it out

['Panty']: like im trying to find a balance between abstract and realistic/ni dotn want it to be just a line becus it looks hella wierd to me/b['QIQI']: well you can just put a dot or a simple line, but then use shade/shadow to put more depth into it, thats the only way./nagain, you should gather reference and try copy, nothing wrong with copying and developing a style/b['Ryuse']: Panty what kind of semi do u wanna draw?/b['Panty']: semirealistic but cartoon inspired/b['Ryuse']: Example?/nNo I mean an art piece/b['Panty']: an art piece/nwhat u mea/b['Ryuse']: A full versio/nLike a whole image/b['Panty']: hmm lemme find one/nlike its detailed but simple at the same time/b['QIQI']: yeh its all about shade, and depth of line

['Drakeanor']: Also for drawing the collarbone, I think using color to emphasize it make characters look more thicc/muscular./b['Pleinair']: collar bone area is always important!

['arumi']: pretty important to make a concept before drawing blindly next time/now youre confused/b['Flavie']: True/nIts difficult to draw without having a frame of story or concept/nAt least for me/nBut maybe you have one and just didnt push through/b['Ryuse']: Hmm I see/nAlright/nI got an idea/b['Flavie']: Anyway its really cool/b['Ryuse']: Ah thank you XD

['tooki']: Hello you guys!\nMightve forgotten me by now, but my name is Karine or Tooki or Kotton on AF, and last year, I organized a huge art telephone game. Now, because of quarantine and sheer boredom, I am going to try and make ANOTHER ONE! This time, Itll be bigger and even more organized.\nWhat is art Telephone?\nArt Telephone is a nice minigame in which a player receives a character and has to draw them in their style. As smaller tweaks turn into personality traits and the difference in skills and styles completely reshape the figure, the finished product will be totally different and will show the awesome development through the drawings. \nWhat am I looking for?\nFirst of all, more staff members! I am looking to turn this into an actual event, and for that reason, I will need people to help me collect the drawings, organize them by numbers and sign new members.\nAlso, obviously, artists like you guys the way your styles differ would look awesome in the project and Id love if anyone wanted to join \nThe Project itself would start by 1.5 Till then, you can still sign up and end by MAXIMUM 1.7. This because artists require a certain amount of time to finish their work! If it takes TOO long, we will pass over to the next artist so manage your time correctly. I am planning on having 4050 members, depending on the complexity of their art and their ability to finish it quickly, so we can reach the best outcomes in the easiest way. \nPlease DM me to apply and become one of those!For now, staff is more necessary so we can organize the project/b['arumi']: Art tele is fun, go join if you have free times/b['PinkC4ndy']: how to join art tele?/b['arumi']: contact that guy/ntooki/bKama: does anyone want their OC to be commissioned?

['oa']: Anime is a rly broad style, there are an endless amount of ways you can draw anime faces/nId say find art you like the most and try imitating and studying the way the faces are drawn in those/b['Liquid', 'Nitroge']: learn realistic first before understanding anime, honestly/nwithout understanding the face, you wont know where to put things/b['HirkaniBunny07']: yee u should random stuff that u like and u will finally find out what u like

['Diamondship']: Paper/b['Mehh']: Omg xD
None: Same here Diamondship/b['Diamondship']: Do you suffer paper getting lost all the time/b['Smugi']: Diamondship I recommend studying the asaro head, and learning how to render a real face before trying to stylize anything.
['Diamondship']: Asaro?/b['Smugi']: if youre struggling to draw an anime face then it all comes back to learning to draw in general. Your fundamentals of Form, Shape, Edges, Values should be learned/nbam/nThe Asaro Head is a very popular tool to learn planes of the face/nand once youve studied planes of the face, do some studies from pinterest or from people./nI got a whole pinterest board of portraits I like to use when I do studies/b['PinkC4ndy']: Guys, I need help with my drawing.

Also remember light and shadows form shapes/nValues/nBut just shift up in your light family if you want shine. Dont airbrush it all bc itll look pillow and ugly/b['ZeroX']: Lel/b['oa']: I been sketching all night but to no avail

Like for example, yellow light, skin, blue hair, red shirt,\nThe red shirt would have orangish to yellow highlights,\nBlue hair should be leaning to green and almost yellow, but not quite there yet, \nand skin should have peachy to really light yellow?/b['HaloPhantomEx']: Ey anyone wanna help me out need a hair style/b['Mehh']: Long or short hair?/b['HaloPhantomEx']: its a dude so short/b['Mehh']: Guys can have long hair ../b['HaloPhantomEx']: tru/b['Mehh']: sth like this maybe?/nIts pretty basic ../b['HaloPhantomEx']: mmm something more ...worrior/fighter light/nlike/ntrying to make a test webtoon see how it goes but i need to make characters so/b['KOANGEL']: manbu/nKek/b['HaloPhantomEx']: i think i can work with that i dont like the bun but i can adjust it

['Akaishio']: isoki dud/nu need more practice/nor to put it more in a very friendly and fun way/njust keep drawing/nalso can I get some tips and tricks on how I can be able to color with a mouse efficiently third time doing digital art/nI also use photoshop cc/nmy tablet broke a while ago and itsprolly gonna arrive at 14th of june/nused a mouse on it thats why the lineart is dumb/b['HaloPhantomEx']: quick nap brb
['ShootingQuasar']: Done/b['lucius']: Done\nShootingQuasar Really nice.
['Reddy']: b/b['s0501402']: Akaishio tbh tho, Drawing lineart with a mouse itself its quite impressive impressive already./b['urabrubraka']: Agrree/b['Jon', 'A']: Cuteee
['Jon', 'A']: Omggg/b['Akeno']: thx x/b['Mehh']: Akaishio cell shading is your best bet, outline the shade u want, then fill it i
['Mehh']: At least thats what I did before/b['danielpro51']: Perfectio
['Mehh']: Can somebody tell me how I can make my art style not be all over the place???/nLike none of these match/nI dont mind 1 or two standing out if I do realism or sth/nBut boiii/b['Jon', 'A']: Theyre all unique its good/b['Mehh']: ALL of em have differently drawn eyes/faces/noses etc/nBut my art feels like its getting worse x.x/b['Blanc.Usagi']: I have this same issue, what i tried is having a picture of a drawing in the style i want to be consistent of next to me when i draw so i know how to train my eye to always draw in that style
['Blanc.Usagi']: And ref sheets for your style you want helps too. Like have the style of eye shapes etc./b['jayck34']: Mehh consistency is the answer, dude/nbut its okay/ni also struggle with that/b['Bardart']: Wip of lass/b['Blanc.Usagi']: Bardart nicee Looks really good so far!/b['Bardart']: Thanks trying to do something different and go for an pastel piece with flowers/b['DeleteMeForeverEvolving']: Mmm/b['Armannamra']: kekw
['nae', 'nezuko']: ice/b['The', 'Wolf']: Hi
['The', 'Wolf']: I made this recently .w./b['Mehh']: jayck34 I already knew, dude/b['TOXiCAK1RA']: How do I share my crappy freehanded art
['Armannamra']: a/b['Sally']: hey, i want to do a challenge. but im stuck. should i do pick 4 drinks to draw as humans or pick 4 brands to draw as humansor pick 4 apps to draw as humans or pick 4 themes 1 word each to draw?
['Hinafuyama']: pick 4 drinks to draw as humans is cool/b['Sally']: oh well, the challenge will be called trans4m challenge, since theres 4 things and in transforming them into humans. so since i cant pick. Ill just do trans4rmApps, Trans4rmThemes Trans4rmDrinks and so on XD/b['KOANGEL']: Ah I miss sakuras art channels
['KOANGEL']: Its been a while hey everyone/b['Freekbird']: Um
['Freekbird']: Fox/catgirl be showing too much P/b['HirkaniBunny07']: Lmao its still a rlly pretty picture
['HaloPhantomEx']: wip/nquestion is there a way to get smoother/cleaner lines/b['ShigeQQ']: Aside from utilizing stabilization if any exists in your application and making sure youre using a brush thats sensitive to pressure adjusts its line weight and width, CTRLZ at least five times for every line there is on your drawing./nNo, Im not exaggerating. 🙂/b['Doggos']: I think... thats traditional?
['Doggos']: pardon me if Im wrong./b['ShigeQQ']: It /was/ traditional. They traced over their traditional sketch which was photographed and pasted onto a canvas. Not uncommon for those who feel more comfortable sketching on paper./b['HaloPhantomEx']: Im originally a traditional artis but trying to get inti digital. And is world stabilizer what your talking about?/b['ShigeQQ']: Just stabilization your stroke will lag slightly behind your pen to correct your lines and soften wobbliness
['HaloPhantomEx']: oh ok/b['Greyald']: Hello, anyone know how to fix this white spot on the line? I use ibispaint x
['HaloPhantomEx']: looks like its on a layer/bKama: Yall gimme idea of what to draw 👉👈
Kama: Anime/manga related/b['Jon', 'A']: Faruq draw big bewbs JK/nI dont draw much so/bKama: Ill draw you, send me a pic/b['Jon', 'A']: Say sike rn 😳/bKama: KPOP/b['Armannamra']: k/b['Mehh']: Anyone else get annoyed when people start flooding 1015 of their drawings at once?..
['HaloPhantomEx']: o/nstill working on it. any other methods of shading instead of making a bunch of mask layers for shading../b['Mehh']: Uh... Making mask layers isnt really a method for shading
['Mehh']: Or well at least not the technique/nYou could just do everything in 1 layer/nWont change your shading style much/b['arumi']: laughs in 200 layers/b['Mehh']: Usually when Im painting I have fewer layers than when Im cell shading, if it helps/b['arumi']: well youre pAInTing/b['Mehh']: Yes/nI expected to use more layers/nFor it though/b['arumi']: painting doesnt need that many layes since you just paint over everything/b['Mehh']: Cuz Im scared of makin mistakes and all/nYeah/b['arumi']: and you said using mask layer isnt a method youre wrong/nwell just different opinion i wont judge/b['Mehh']: I corrected myself and said technique/b['arumi']: well? its still a technique/b['Mehh']: Technique for me is where you place those shadows, how detailed are they, what strokes do you use, etc/b['arumi']: if you have multiple characters in a canvas its easier for each has their own mask layer to not confuse one and other/nand the tools you use, which is mask layer/b['Mehh']: Cant really say I can consider it a tool but ok x.x/nAnd yeah layers do make things easier/nDont know why youre trying to run away from them if theyre at your dispositio/b['arumi']: run away from what/b['Mehh']: Using masks/nThe person asked is there other ways to shade/nU ca/b['arumi']: because theyre not used to it?/nlayers are confusing if you dont know how they work/nconsidering hes still new/nHaloPhantomEx you can use clipping layer or alpha lock on ibis paint/b['Mehh']: l/nYou gonna have to learn one way or another/nNot knowing is gonna limit ya.../b['arumi']: I mean thats why he asked/b['Mehh']: Dude.../b['arumi']: yes?/b['Mehh']: Nvm it sigh
['Mehh']: Just look up some tutorials there isnt a thing that doesnt have a tutorial nowadays/nEach layer is practically adding like an invisible sheet that only records and shows the things you draw on it/b['arumi']: are you explaining it to me or/b['Mehh']: No/b['arumi']: ah gotchu/b['Mehh']: sigh/nAnyhow/nIf youre unsatisfied with how you drew something on one layer you can just delete it or clear it or hide it/nHiding it will still keep your drawing intact, so you can draw multiple things, but if you feel like the first thing you drew was best after all you can just hide the other layers and keep the one from before/nIf that makes sense/nClearing layers will reset them to a blank canvas, usually just by pressing the delete button on your keyboard/nAnd deleting the layer will completely remove everything on canvas and the canvas itself/nLearn how to name and organise them and put them all in a folder to make things easier for you/nIf layers really were the problem/nIf you just dont want to use many of them then just draw on less?/b['HaloPhantomEx']: I ment clipping layers my b/b['Mehh']: That still doesnt tell me much at all/nYou can just not use them literally/nYou can limit yourself to 1 layer, 2 or 3/nOr you can make a new layer for every stroke if you want/nStill not rly gonna help you improve your shading.../b['HaloPhantomEx']: I mean like a simpler way using clipping layers is the method i use but then it gets unorganized and u end up with a crap tone of layers./b['Mehh']: Then u dont need a new way to shade but a way to organise/nIf I feel like I have too many layers and Im satisfied with where Im going/nI just merge them into 1/nOr two/nOr just.. Less/b['HaloPhantomEx']: thank you feel bad for asking a stupid question like this. I wanted to see how others do their shading bc i see some ppl use the gradient tool. Or just fill the art work in with a darker shade then erase where light hits the said object. And i wanted to find a simpler method of doing it
['ShigeQQ']: You gonna have to learn one way or another\nI really dislike this approach toward telling someone how to improve at art yes, while many artists advance themselves through their knowledge of their program, some choose to forge their own techniqueone that may seem unconventional to others, but can be applied effectively on their own works and can be improved upon.\nHe doesnt need to abandon masks to learn how to shade, just as how I dont need to use glow effects for highlights. Its an option. Not a requirement./nUh... Making mask layers isnt really a method for shading\n Or well at least not the technique\nAnything can be a technique. If masking his layers functions as part of a process regarding his shading, it qualifies as his technique./nHaloPhantomEx Dont feel bad, and dont limit yourself to a single suggestion. Explore, experiment, and addend to your process as you see fit, whether it be how comfortable you are with it or the quality of your work./b['HaloPhantomEx']: Ok ill try that/bNone: doodles
