[BOT]: I really wish it wasn't so hot and humid every day.	[USER]: Me too. I can't wait until winter.	[BOT]: I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.	[USER]: I'd rather it be cold than hot.	[BOT]: Me too.
[USER]: It's such a nice day.	[BOT]: Yes, it is.	[USER]: It looks like it may rain soon.	[BOT]: Yes, and I hope that it does.	[USER]: Why do you like it rains?	[BOT]: I really love how rain clears the air.	[USER]: Me too. It always smells so fresh after it rains.	[BOT]: Yes, but I love the night air after it rains.	[USER]: I really hope it rains today.	[BOT]: Yeah, me too.
[USER]: Isn't it a nice day?	[BOT]: It really is.	[USER]: It seems that it may rain today.	[BOT]: Hopefully it will.	[USER]: I especially love the night air when it rains.	[BOT]: Me too, I really want it to rain today.
[USER]: I really want to go to the beach this weekend.	[BOT]: That sounds like fun. What's the weather going to be like?	[USER]: I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.	[BOT]: Is it going to be perfect beach weather?	[USER]: Yes, it will be fun to go the beach in that weather.	[BOT]: Good. I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.	[USER]: I know. I really want to go to the beach.	[BOT]: But you know that California weather is really unpredictable.	[USER]: You're right. One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.	[BOT]: I really wish the weather would just stay the same.	[USER]: I do too. That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.	[BOT]: Yeah, that would make things a lot easier.
[USER]: I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.	[BOT]: A trip to the beach would be fun. How is the weather going to be?	[USER]: The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.	[BOT]: So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?	[USER]: It sounds like it will be.	[BOT]: I really hope it doesn't get cold.	[USER]: That would ruin things, I want to go so badly.	[BOT]: The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.	[USER]: That is true. The weather is constantly changing.	[BOT]: It would be nice if the weather would never change.	[USER]: That would be great, then we could plan things sooner.	[BOT]: True. Predictable weather would make life easier.
[USER]: It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.	[BOT]: What's the weather going to be like? I may want to go too.	[USER]: The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.	[BOT]: Will it be good beach weather?	[USER]: I think it will be.	[BOT]: It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.	[USER]: I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm.	[BOT]: This California weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen.	[USER]: I know. Every day the weather seems different.	[BOT]: I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.	[USER]: That would make it easier for us to make plans.	[BOT]: I know. Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like.
[USER]: Are you going to the party on Saturday?	[BOT]: I was thinking about it. Are you?	[USER]: Yeah, I heard it's going to be a lot of fun.	[BOT]: Really? Well, what time will it start?	[USER]: It will start at 8:00 pm, and I really think you should go.	[BOT]: Well, who else are going to be there?	[USER]: Everybody from school.	[BOT]: How do you know it's going to be so fun?	[USER]: This party is going to have a DJ, food, and drinks.	[BOT]: Wow, that does sound like it's going to be fun.	[USER]: So am I going to see you at the party?	[BOT]: Yeah, I will be there.
[USER]: What will you be doing this weekend?	[BOT]: I am not sure. What will you be doing?	[USER]: I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach.	[BOT]: That sounds like a great idea!	[USER]: Would you be interested in joining me?	[BOT]: Sure, I would love to go with you. When would you be leaving?	[USER]: I thought that we could leave around 8:00 in the morning. How do you think?	[BOT]: That would give us plenty of time to explore. Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara?	[USER]: That was part of my plan.	[BOT]: Well then, I'll see you on Saturday. Thanks for inviting me to go with you.
[USER]: I can't figure out what to get Mary for her birthday. Do you have any suggestions?	[BOT]: I am having a problem figuring that out myself. It's kind of challenging, uhh? Do you want to pick something out together?	[USER]: Yes, that way we would have more money to spend.	[BOT]: She has a lot of interests. What things do you think she likes to do the best?	[USER]: Well, she really likes going hiking, listening to music, and travel.	[BOT]: The music idea sounds good. I wonder who knows what concerts she might like to go to?	[USER]: Maybe we could ask her roommate, Maria, who her favorite groups are.	[BOT]: Maria would be a great help. She has known Mary for a long time.	[USER]: Let's e-mail Maria and ask her for her suggestions.	[BOT]: I think that maybe Maria might like to contribute to this gift too.
[USER]: Come right on in, Jade, and welcome to our home!	[BOT]: It's so nice to see you, Maria. What a wonderful home!	[USER]: Would like some drinks? I can offer you lemonade, iced tea, or mango juice.	[BOT]: Iced tea sounds really good right now! It was really hot driving over here.

[USER]: You know, we could check online at the local websites.	[BOT]: Great idea. Let's take a look!	[USER]: What kind of food would you prefer for your birthday?	[BOT]: I enjoy Chinese or Cuban food the best.	[USER]: This restaurant, Silver Palace, looks good.	[BOT]: Oh yes, I've been there once. Everyone I've spoken with says that it is great!	[USER]: Would you like to go there then?	[BOT]: I think that would be a really good choice! Let's call and make a reservation.
[USER]: Jade, do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday?	[BOT]: I don't really know where I should go. I am having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant.	[USER]: There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the newspaper.	[BOT]: OK, let's take a look at that.	[USER]: Do you have a particular type of food that you would like?	[BOT]: No really, but Chinese or Korean food might be what I prefer.	[USER]: That Chinese restaurant received many good reviews.	[BOT]: Oh yeah! I saw a review of that restaurant on television. The reviewers loved it!	[USER]: Would that be a place that you might like to go to for your birthday?	[BOT]: That would work out great! Let's call to make sure that we can get a table for that night.
[USER]: Hello, may I speak to Jade please?	[BOT]: This is Jade. How's it going?	[USER]: I've been trying to call you all day.	[BOT]: Sorry about that. I was cleaning up.	[USER]: It's okay. Don't worry about the phone call.	[BOT]: So what were you calling me about?	[USER]: Oh, I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow.	[BOT]: Sure, what did you want to do?
